Apple, apricots, slight tannin
Rich mouth feel

This one made me gag--I was told by my partner that this was a taste test where people who don't like coffee might find a coffee they like, but I really thought all of these mostly sucked (sorry!). I think I am destined to only like very chocolately sugary ice-cold coffee. We are planning to take all of these and ice them and add some oat milk to see if we like it more then!

Granny Apple and caramel
A bit citric fruity
Very fruity & light, like juice.
Creamy? Bright start. Spoiled Milk, but in a good way.

After James' discussion: CARAMEL. I think I liked this more than D but would order D instead because it's funkier in a more interesting experience. Incredibly delicious coffee.

To me this was a very expected coffee flavor from someone who has been getting into coffee for the last 3-4 years, I could drink this coffee almost everyday, could add milk or creamer and it would pair well I would think, definitely tasted caramel at the beginning, noticed more acidity once it cooled.

This smells like it’s meant to be a bit sweet, but without adding milk/sugar, I’m not sure, it’s buried in the bitter/acid and just comes across sour.

---
After the tasting, James revealed that this was a washed Kenyan. I would definitely also have enjoyed this same coffee as a natural process: maybe even more.
It tasted to me like when an espresso is pulled really thin. I disliked it when hot and cooled. Strong dislike.
Toffee, toasted marshmallow, maple, lavender, light body
Carmel, nutty, vanilla. I enjoyed this one and would enjoy a week of this as I drank through a bag of beans. Daily drinker for sure.
Sweeter berries. It tasted light with higher clarity
Lemon, freeze dried raspberry, a hint of dark chocolate with cranberry chunks. Fresh squeezed lemon juice with a touch of pith, but overall pleasant. This is juicy and clean, right up my wheelhouse.

Juicy, pleasant acidity, dry mouthfeel
Citrus, lemon
Super sour.  Perhaps sour tart cherries?  I felt like the taste didn't change over time as it cooled.  Felt my mouth puckered every time I took a sip.  Also, experimented separately by adding the same amount light cream to all of the coffees and this coffee does not do well with cream. Reaffirmed my belief that my preferences are not with fruity and acidic coffees.
bright, hay, straw, fruity, light, clear, tea
Citrus, bright, lemon, brown sugar, baked apple, black cherry. Better as it cooled down
Lemon, raspberry, cut grass / lemongrass, rose hip

Most surprising in terms of how much less bitter it tasted after cooling down, fruity flavours were more apparent when cold, had the most predictable aftertaste I'd expect from coffee

Nothing offensive or exemplary, it was a pleasant cup that while I did not love next to the the other offerings, I would not remember if served it at a cafe. That said I would never complain either.

Sour, apple-y
Berries, fruit, clarity
Maple syrup hazelnut red apple
Citrus
My first thought was “awful”, which was my first learning experience from the event. Since I usually use a moka pot to make coffee, I wasn’t expecting the difference in taste, based on how the coffee was made. While Initially I found it unpleasant and thought it had sort of a moldy taste, overtime, and as the temperature lowered, I felt the taste improved.

Citrusy, fruity, plum
Sour apple, grape
Good fruit and sweetness
Smooth
Round, toffee
citrussy, sweet
Cacao Nibs, citrus
The acidity was a little bit too biting. A bit like drinking lemon juice. I enjoy some acidity, but not quite to that extent.

Comes across as a nice, unassuming coffee when hot but once it starts to cool the acidity really shows itself and goes from good to quite tasty.

2nd to least favorite black, favorite with milk and sugar, strong aroma of soy sauce
Sweet, well balanced.
Fruit -- pear or apple
Fairly balanced, citrus fruit, maybe lemon, coconut

Thin, light, airy, chocolate
Darkish roast, bitter, thin mouthfeel
Chocolatey, tonic water bitterness
Even balance, lighter body, caramel finish

Opened up to nuttier flavors as it cooled.  Bitterness was a bit too much for me, kind of bad diner coffee vibes.
smooth, mild sweetness, milk chocolate, a good everyday coffee
Nutty, chocolate
Big contrast when tasting this right after Coffee A. Bitterness is noticeable, but does not detract from the experience. Nice "smoothness" that seems to get more stronger as the coffee cools. May even be getting less bitter and more "acidic-tasting" as it cools as well. Specific tasting notes a bit hard to distinguish (nutty?)
Mouthfeel felt flat; had a nice bitter-sweet balance
Chocolate, nuts. This one was mid on bitterness for me and low on acidity, I love these darker flavors inside this coffee
Very inoffensive, seems a general over coffee. Something Id give to a friend whos never had any coffee before in their life, or was use to Starbucks coffee. Extremely “ok” in the best sense, very friendly to first time coffee drinkers.

Hollower than A but thicker mouthfeel, much more bitter on subsequent re-tastes – not particularly down with this one

Vanilla, sweet
Alright but seems like a safe choice. I enjoyed it once it cooled down, but preferred C more
Chocolate, nut, chocolate mousse
Chocolate
Cinnamon

Thick mouthfeel, complex, licorice (?), blander tasting in reverse order.  Will recommend this one to a co-worker who has been looking for a darkish, heavier coffee.  It seems really well balanced.

spice?
Chocolate, leaves, fall, wine
Chocolatey, cake, mild spices, medium body
Not a bad cup. Had more 'bass' notes for me than any of the others. If I had pulled this as an espresso shot it would pair well with a bit of steamed, whole milk -- think cortado.

brown taste, smells the best, strong mouth feel

I very much enjoyed this one.  Nothing felt overwhelming.  In fact, I'd call it mild.  Even with my enjoyment of sweetened coffee, I'd consider drinking this one with nothing added.
Smooth. Somewhat sweet and chocolatey? Muddled/confused on tasting notes. More clear as it cooled, but still a lot to unravel.

At first smoky tasting, less so as it cooled.

Started off as the most bitter, hard to taste much else. Acidity more recognizable as it cooled and the bitterness wore off; chocolate & faint blackberry undertones
Most texture
Heavier mouthfeel. Dark chocolate, caramel, smoky, toasted almond. Bitterness is higher when hot- from 4 to 3 as it cooled.
Chocolate, nutty
Clarity - 3
Confusing, acidity and bitterness are very balanced, I don't understand why I like it
not as flavorful as the others, but still nice. very middle of the road in terms of light vs dark, and robustness

Chocolate, mushroom
Chocolaty
inoffensive and pleasant at all temperatures. very thin mouthfeel.

Liked this one, it felt balanced and had a mouthfeel I enjoyed. It changed for me over the tasting but I kept liking it.

Flavors balanced as the coffee cooled. Started as a bitter man and ended a balanced blend.
Milk chocolate and Pie crust
bacon, chocolate

Dark chocolate, tasted better as it cooled
Beer
Chocolate
Earthy and chocolatey. Changed the most as it cooled. Initial taste was incredibly bitter, but lessened significantly as it cooled, but oddly enough, only once it got close to room temperature. It was still bitter as it was cooling, but then seemed to hit a point abruptly when the bitterness seemed to subside.

As I would return to this cup, it may have had an unfair uphill battle as I would think to myself “oh, this was the bitter one. Yep, still bitter”.

 I had thought it was my least favorite of the four, but towards the end of the stream (but before the coffees were revealed) as I compared it to Coffee C, the two seemed to almost switch places on me. C became what my initial impression of B was, and B became what my initial impression of C was. This could have been due to the fact that I was giving A and D more of my attention because I enjoyed them more and was more eager to return to them and crown a favorite, whereas I wasn’t as excited to return to B and C.
Okay, slightly earthy, nutty, dense/heavy/thick
Chocolate cake
Very balanced, simple and casual coffee to drink. Its only downfall might be that it's a little too basic and lacks more fun flavors or complexity like the other coffees. This nails the fundamentals of what makes a good coffee good but won't win any contests because it's not experimental.
Balanced, Round, chocolate, Apple
Initially tasted like battery acid. Got better as it cooled.

Dark, unpleasant chocolate and charcoal
This is the most similar to coffee that I usually drink. When it was hot, it felt very light bodied, but it had less flavor intensity than the other coffees. As it cooled, I enjoyed the smoothness and coco notes.
Soft, balanced
Flat taste.
Instant coffee nuts
Christmas nuts
roasty
Milk chocolate, winter/gingerbread, smoke, urine
Gas station,spices
Chocolate, Blueberry, very fruity
I like all coffee though, just relative preference
The bitterness subsiding as it cooled really caught me off guard. I didn't record it because I thought it was just palate fatigue.
No distinctive flavor, vegetation, tastes like hotel coffee
dark chocolate, balanced
Most full-bodied in texture out of the 4. Notes of tangerine, slightly nutty
Very balanced. At first, too balanced if that makes sense, nothing to hook me in. Peanut and caramel, snickers bar.
Sharp, grains, plain
Fruity faint aroma, some acid
Marshmallow, Chocolate
Chocolate, stone fruit, red berries
strong aftertaste, very bitter when hot but reduced as it cooled down, minor acidity, smoky wood notes.

Slightly nutty, but overall lacking any complexity/any specific notes.
Boring but easy drinking.

I agreed with your analysis

Strong walnutty flavor on the finish?
Reminded me of warm spices. Balanced to me.
Savory, muddy
Cocoa
Lowest body; most tea-like in mouth feel
Very subtle dark chocolate (btwn bittersweet and bakers) 
Not as interesting as the others - so balanced at times it was forgettable
funky
This was my runner-up coffee from the tasting. It certainly has more nutty and chocolatey notes that I enjoy. It was a little less exciting in the taste and mouth feel, which is why I put it below Klatch, however, I would gladly drink this regularly.

I found this coffee pretty flat, lacking dynamism, especially when hot. Got a bit fuller as it cooled. Faint chocolate. Sort of oily and filmy texture. Dark.
Juicy, light, and a bit tart.
Nutty, bolder, almost dusty
Guessed origin: Hawaii (wrong)
Nutty aftertaste, dark chocolate, very smooth and good clarity. Chill at risk of being boring (not in a bad way, just a great daily drink)
Oily mouth feel, coats mouth (derogatory), got better as it cooled
Butter, pastry, chocolate
Light, chocolate
Milk chocolate
Red Fruit, Cocoa
Peanuts
Very tea-like, clean crisp cup, I'm guessing a PNG/Bali, or high-end expensive Latin American.
Dark chocolate and coconut
Earthy tones. Got worse as it cooled.
Just tastes like coffee
Hazelnut taste. Smooth finish
This one had to cool down before I could tolerate it. An initial immediate hit of a very offputting aroma/flavor. I immediately went to the smell of the Walmart automotive section. A very plastic/petroleum note. As this cooled, the initial hit mellowed out to the point where it was almost gone, at which point there were notes of floral and chocolate.
Nice mellow coffee
Balanced, favorite
Sweet
This has a special something I love — maybe from the Ethiopian in the mix?  (Pretty consistently a favorite origin for me.)  It’s a factor in the aroma, I think…  Or, possibly just because it’s a well-constructed blend. :)
dark chocolate, smokiness slightly? and nuttiness possibly
Balanced more body. Roundness
Balanced, chocolate
Well rounded coffee
Chocolate, nuts
Nutty, wood, bland
Kinda smoky. Less distinct flavors to me.
Extremely well-executed more traditional coffee flavor. One of my favorites of the bunch, despite my usual preferences.
Bloomy bright
Apple and nut
Cola. To me, some espresso has a slight metallic taste and this coffee had it to a lesser degree. I feel like it could be caused by carbonic acid if the coffee was too fresh, but it's also possible some people enjoy the taste.
Sweet, Fruity, very balanced and clear, smoothest mouthfeel. This was my second or third favorite at the start. As the coffees cooled this one changed the least the only difference was that the flavors became more and more clear. I generally prefer single origins however this was possibly my favorite one while cool
Toffee, chocolate
Honestly hard to say...very light flavors
Milk chocolate, apricots
Fullness, blooms
Tasty
Nondescript, okay
More full bodied, caramel. Colombia?
Not super flavorful, may have been user error in brewing, Graham cracker
Neutral

Medium Body
Nutty, Malty
The one I would most be comfortable adding milk to.
Loved this one. Full flavored… smooth?
Milk chocolate, cola, chalky, light/medium body
Toasted malt and paper. Middle of the road on this one - tastes like a standard drip you could find just about anywhere.
More savory and a bit sour. Definitely darker.
Thin, dry paper, unremarkable and not all that pleasant, but not unpleasant. If I had to guess, this is barely specialty, 80 scoring Brazilian that’s medium roasted. Similar to the low end from the Ghost Cupping Club. The more it cools the worst it tastes, but not commodity dark roast bad.
Chocolate
Smokey, cocoa
Bitter, brown, inoffensive

Silky mouth feel, but i leaves my mouth feeling a bit dry once the flavor fades.

Coffee-flavored. Dimmer than Equator.
Mellow, round & full mouth feel
Full bodied
Was my favorite for most of the test and went down the smoothest, a bit more kick than I was expecting as it cooled
Nutty - chocolatey. Slightly astringent. Really familiar flavor I can't place. Is it a nut? Or a fresh herb?
Thin, slippery mouth feel. Smokey. Savory.
Flat
By comparison not very interesting. Relatively mild and lacking in depth. Still decent coffee.
Chocolate, bitterness dropped noticably as temp dropped
Dark chocolatey with a hint of fruit.  Kinda reminds me of the fruit and nut chocolate bar.  Felt very balanced and not too dark.  Tastes great with a touch of light cream.  Because it is a light and balanced coffee, I think adding too much cream would mute the flavors so if I were to add cream next time, I would just do a splash.
chocolate, stale, bland, balanced
Milk chocolate, sweet, creamy
Milk chocolate, caramel, medium body
cilantro, mole
Surprised at how much less of an aftertaste it had, started harder but faded away after a while, felt the 'least offensive', would not be inclined to turn this down if offered
Roasty
I liked this coffee more as the test went on, but overall disliked it quite a bit. I was shocked to find it was a medium roast and that there was something roasted darker in the test. I did not find any fruit flavors at all, thought the sweetness did present itself as it cooled.
toasted tobacco, mellow smoke, buttery mouth feel
Milk chocolate
roasty but started to show a little berry fruit as it cooled. balanced. toffee, butterscotch, ash. hint of baking spice

Bitter out the gates, but settles quickly with little aftertaste

I didn’t get any notes that stood out. This struck me as a solid morning cup, one that would sit well and not overwhelm me.

Lots of flavor in the beginning then immediately all the taste disappears
Round, semi-sweet chocolate
acidic
I thought this was a very very neutral coffee - it tasted like classic, very very well balanced coffee. 
It got a bit more interesting as it cooled but overall I thought that the balance worked against it (to me). I think if I got served this at a cafe, I would have been very satisfied and thought it was very well made. I just prefer more chaos in the cup?

Almost tasted like diner coffee
barbecue
This was my second favorite of the bunch. Very much enjoyed it, could easily drink it all day. Interesting flavors, and extremely balanced. Seemed potentially a darker roast than coffee A, and I definitely lean towards light roasts.
Dark chocolate
Earthy, more balanced, leafy? Tastes like fallen leaves. Thicker mouthfeel than the others
Is very mellow doesn't have any sort of punch like the more acidic cups with a nice undertone of sweetness
Very good "coffee" coffee

My initial preference among A/B/C, but by the end it was my least favourite, tasting quite metallic as it cooled.
Nutty
taste like regular coffee

This was my dads favorite
My personal favorite of this group
Nothing discernable
Burnt east, similar but more mellow than c

Another well rounded one, less full than b feels a bit lighter in the mouth. Still a very good one
Bland, very slightly fruity (berry), grainy
Very mellow/smooth- more character than coffee B

Brown sugar
Wateriest, beans
Medium toasty, thin mouthfeel, slight tangy
Not very clear
Chocolatey, smooth, lighter body but more than B

nutty and fruity -pear/cranberry
Milder, rounder nutty flavor coconut
vegtable, herb
When following Coffee B, a bit hard to distinguish at the start, but as it cools, noticing that it may be the most bitter...but sweeter at the same time? Sort of honey vibes as it cools down.
Felt the most deep and full in the mouth
This was the hardest one for me to dissect. I got mild chocolate and nuts, but this one reminded me the most of "coffee" just a standard good cup of coffee
I started out disliking this a great amount but as I tasted the others and contrasted each I began liking it more and more until it became my favorite.
first taste- hated

Herbal, grassy
Tonic, Bitter Bomb
Fruity and earthy
Kind of the sulfury hint in the smoke after you strike, then blow out a match

Chocolate
Browner, muted fruit flavors but not as much as B, baked peach

Dirt, mud, water
Fermented fruit, apple , medium body, nuttiness
This was not terrible. It was a nice cup of coffee but it wasn't special. Unremarkable. Had I been served this cup in a diner or cafe I wouldn't have had any objections. It just didn't rise to the quality levels I serve in my home. Meh, is the official verdict on this one.
Mild
Apricot
Brown sugar
faint leather taste
rounded, mild
Sour cherry, melted dark chocolate, dry leaf, corn husk
A nuttier balanced flavour profile and easily the favoured of the 4
Bit roasty, deep caramels, slight astringency, more balanced and sweet on cooling- this one was fine and is definitely a crowd-pleaser but reminded me of drip from Caribou/Pike Place from Starbucks. Not my fav.
Increasing bitterness as cooled
Reminds me of the second wave of coffee, little darker food with some milk
Slightly earthy and tasted slightly more bitter as time went on. One of my favorites for everyday drinking along with A.

Darker roast. Balanced, but also rather one-dimensional. Smoothest, but weakest flavor. Maybe what I'd drink a large mug of, but boring compared to my normal dark roasts.
Tree, wood
Complex, moderate mouthfeel,
almost too light but not objectionable initially - too tasted darker as it cooled
Cherry maybe? Aftertaste similar to dark chocolate, low acidity at first, but grew much more acidic after cooled down
Sour toasted nut smell. Suddenly really bitter when not following B. Top note of ashtray with more toasted nuts.
Heavy feel. Burnt flavor, Umami.

Funky herby note somewhere in there? Not intense but not boring either.
Good balance, strong taste in every sequence of tasting and focus on note.
Balanced, tea
Woody, Birth, flowers
As this cooled, it became my preferred coffee of the selection. I also after the test, added some oat milk, and it remained my preferred coffee of the selection (I added oat milk to all and compared again just for fun). I thought it was balanced and after cooling a bit was the most balanced--even though I thought it was more bitter and less acidic.
Chocolatey. Somewhat nutty, but less than B.
Oaxaca, chemical, chocolate, weak
Higher viscosity grassy lemon
1st impression: I like
Vivid notes, but sugary
2nd round: very smooth 
3rd round: less body/thickness
Bitter aftertaste, almost chemical flavor as it cooled
I did not get the dark and bitter flavor that James talked about for this one.  I found it to be almost as sour as A, but less aggressive.  That slightly lower sour flavor made it better for me.
Very earthy. Better as it cooled. Muddled/confused on what I'm tasting. Lots to unravel, like B.
Very ashy when hot, becomes more palatable at room temp. Cocoa under the ash.

Thickest mouth feel, dark sugar, grassy, lingering tobacco finish.
I would try making this bolder with less water. Comfy and familiar

Felt like the most complex. Really changed, lightened/less bitter, as it cooled for me. Savory.
Okay
Mild chocolate, cocoa, black tea, low clarity.
Peach/Black Berries
This one really confused me, I think because I rarely drink dark roast, but I liked it and thought it was a lighter roast then B. Nicely balanced, sweet with nutty and fruit notes. Costa Rica?
Heavy, harsh, bitter at the front, smoky
Sweet, but not fruity sweet.  Nuttiness.  Milky.  Would do great with a splash of milk.

Nutty and roasted flavours with some chocolate.

This one hit most of the notes I look for in a coffee, but lacked a bit of the roast I tend to look for. This coffee tasted the most complete and balanced to me, but I struggle to pick a favorite between B and C.
Smells neutral with some mild grassiness, fruity taste, some acidity, bitterness initially lower (maybe increases as it cools?), fairly neutral tasting, best body of the 4, similar to B but LOUDER
Dark, bold
60% chocolate, but old. Also, I'm not a huge chocolate fan
Dark chocolate
Slightly floral once cool
Spice

Nutty and balanced with a lighter mouthfeel. Tasted like a medium medium roast, but super dark. Got a lot more bitter as it cooled.
Has flavors of coffee that I don't like as much. Bitter in an unpleasant way.
First note, I have covid, my taste is a bit skewed.  This one immediately hit me as a typical roast you'd get at a cafe or diner. No particular flavor jumped out for me.
vaguely woody. lack of clarity in picking out specific flavor notes. "generically" dark roast
Chocolate
Creamy body, bitter punch, some fruit notes
Good for a daily driver.  balanced to my taste buds, slightly higher in Bitterness.
I just couldn't... didn't like this at all.
Mild, light
reminds me of a donut shop coffee
Ash Smoke Heavy
Baked, milk chocolate
lemon, chocolate, best balance between both
very dark jam
bitter, blue cheese flavor (tainted florals), berries, dry papery sweetness
This is my preference. Grew up in Australia so it might be due to to the Sumatran blend being close to what I grew up with.
astringent tannins, minor-ly tea like
Bad aftertaste

Perception of bitterness was higher as it cooled than when hot (surprising). Initial score on bitterness was 2, but rises to 3-4 after it cooled. Acidity was somewhat perceptible at 137 degrees but went away when cooled to room temp.
Clean bitterness, pleasant, earthy but in a more pleasant way than B
Warm, round
Chocolate
Light, soft
Liked better after cooling
Fruity, lighter
Hershey's Milk Chocolate bar/kiss

Full, dark, cocoa

Sweet milk chocolate
Silky, creamy, slightly fruity, tree nuts, earthy, my personal favorite
Dry leather
Really nice! (Once I knew this was a blend, I correctly guessed this was a version of Mocha-Java).
Lowest clarity. Pear, creme brule, toasted peanut. Flavors opened up as it cooled. Could pick up wet hulled influence but not describe it blind.
Balanced. Creamy body. Nutty and toasty flavors.
Dry yet balanced, a little like chocolate flavors. I liked it more when it was cool.

Clarity - 1

Dark chocolate-like balance of acidity and bitterness, medium/heavier body, quite tasty but not my preference
rich and robust, most bitter of the bunch but not to an unpleasant degree, and full of flavor. nutty flavor upfront instead of aftertaste like A. absolutely delicious
Pleasant & balanced. A bit muted.
Neutral, caramel, browned butter, sweet.
More body than coffee B, mellow/smooth, what I think of an archetypal cup of coffee is. Becomes more bitter with almond milk and I like it less than when black.

Chocolate
Carmel Apple, dark chocolate
Well rounded "typical" coffee. Nutty, chocolatey, medium acidity
Dark chocolate, dark berries
Earthy
Roasty toasty, nutty. Generally not my vibe but maybe with cream I'd enjoy it more. Weirdly get a little banana? Maybe mouth-feel brain-trickery?
Milk chocolate
Bright, Apple
Definitely better hot.  It was very smooth, and my second favorite.
Acidic and bright
Thicker, richer than the rest. Brown flavors, almost musty (seems an overly negative word, I don’t dislike it!). Heavy.
Cream, agave, flower
Lighter body; indiscernible fruit flavor.
Burnt hair, smokey, peat, charcoal
Initially the cup tasted very balanced with no prominent notes. Bitterness increased as it cooled, some chocolate notes started to come out as well
I thought this one seemed not as bitter as the first two, but then I got hit with an awful aftertaste and--you might be able to guess by now--I gagged.
balanced, light finish, good, pistachio, white chocolate

I found this to be a good rendition of an average cup of coffee. I could drink this as an everyday cup of coffee.

Rich,med-dark
milk caramel, honey, taffy
Tobacco, Earthy, Black Tea, Milk Chocolate
Not much aroma, more acid upon sitting, stood up to milk
This one was very bitter to me, especially as it started to cool.  Reminded me of a very intense dark chocolate.
Nice.  Not my favorite.  Some kind of fermented note at the end I don't love.
bitter
changed the most as it cooled
Very robust. Very similar to what I drink on a regular basis.
Balanced. What I describe as a "pure coffee experience" for me. Chocolatey and a bit of caramel. Loved this one. As James noted that someone else noted, I also usually prefer light to light/medium roast, as I generally find dark roast too strong, too intense, very unpleasant, so I was surprised to learn that this was dark roast.
Grape and plum
Heavy mouth feel.
rich or full
Roasted, nutty, Heavy, dark chocolate
Indonesian?    Lots of bass notes, some chocolate?     I like it.
Sweet, fruity & chocolate like, I think this one also tastes like what coffee is supposed to taste like in memories, like this is what nostalgia tastes like. I really liked it.
Juicy, Light, Berry
Got much better and more flavor as it cooled. Apricot, honey and something else I haven’t identified yet.
Smooth Jazz. Nice texture.  Slightly bitter ending.
Toffee, stone fruit, brown sugar
Sharp and heavy, chocolate notes as it cools
Dry, better as cools, interesting, became my favorite.

Hot garbage

Herbaceous like the stem of a cruciferous vegetable
Almost spoiled skim milk
smooth

Got a lot of fruit, plum/cherry. Pineapple? Also I was apparently very wrong on the bitterness vs acidity and perceived roast level.
subtle, clean
Dark chocolate, dark roast, light body
Mild, light, slightly fruity, bittersweet chocolate
Like a bite of bittersweet baking chocolate at the front - then had a finish of almond and the skin of a ripe pear
Blueberry?
pretzel after taste, smooth flavor
Couldn’t taste any flavors; initial bitterness isn’t strong but aftertaste is extreme bitterness and lingers for a long time, especially when cool.

Dark, burnt, bacon, semi-hollow
Shallow finish when hot
First taste was like popcorn, an interesting aftertaste, maybe floral? Clear

Dusty, robusta?
Soft mouthfeel, smooth finish
Chocolate
Very sharp tasting while hot, but cooled down nicely.
woody
tobacco, earthy
Originally I thought middle of the road acidity level, but I increased my rating as it cooled. I struggled to come up with any notes on this one.
Spiced cake. Nuts. Cereal
Not getting much at first. Nutty, burnt. Felt thin bodied initially but later thickened up. A bit boring
Nice bitterness, heaviest, darkest, increased bitterness as cooled
berries, chocolate
Sharp, but hard to define any specific flavors. Sort of smelled a bit like diaper after awhile, which hampered my enjoyment.
This tasted like a dark roast which isn’t my preference. But I felt I could doctor it up with cream and sugar and something drinkable. I really disliked the other three.
bit nutty
Chocolate
Autumn- warm (cinnamon?). I'd drink this with cream and sugar.
The least acidic, darkest and fullest flavor.
Too bitter, not really a fan, sort of all the stuff about coffee I don’t love.

Smoke, wood
Kiwi fruit, milk chocolate, stale, berries
More bitterness, but a touch more sweetness.
Coca Cola
Meh

Earthy, dark chocolate, dark heavier notes. Great hot but really full flavored as it cooled. Great first cup type coffee for me. Not as much a sipping coffee.
pancake
Chocolate /nutty
Reminded me of milk chocolate. Would also use this for a daily cup in the morning.
mild & easy to drink
Blueberry
Balanced but a little bit bitter. Chocolate. Jammy fruit.
Quite light and can still taste the bitterness
A bit intense
This is a cup I'd describe as "brown water". I don't get anything from this cup at all. I can tell this is a darker roast, it's got a denser mouthfeel, and I'd honestly be disappointed if I got a bag of these beans.
thicker mouthfeel, chocolatey, warmth/depth
Chocolatey. Smooth.
Very chocolate milk like flavor.

Balanced full body foundation with pleasant floral fruit overlay. More complex than C, but didn’t evolve as nicely as it cooled.

My favorite of the lot. This just tastes like a standard cup of coffee. The roast level removes some of the flavor.
Fatty nuts, dark chocolate, earthy
Higher bitterness than B while hot, improved as it cooled. 
Sweet and nutty when cool

Origin: Brazil
Liked more drinking than tasting with spoon
Bitter finish, rough mouth feel
The bitterness over time made it hard for me to identify flavors. Mocha Java is my favorite Equator coffee, but I usually add milk, so this was incredibly interesting.
Roasted notes; lighter body; little acidity
Black roast, hints of fruits. Lacking the chocolate and vanilla I normally expect.
Very pleasant and maybe most balanced. No specific "non-coffee" flavors jumped out at me. Acidity rose most noticeably for me as it cooled. The one I liked best of the four.
heavy mouthfeel, dirty, brownies
Muddled
This is sorta what I think of as a baseline American coffee. I would be happy receiving this at a coffee shop.
Creamiest of the bunch. Dark richness. Pie crust. Dessert qualities. Not my jam.
Bitter at first but mellowed out as it cooled
Astringent

Clean, Vanilla
Medium body, Burnt, Smooth, subtle smoke, treacle, becoming less bitter, more complex than 2 but still limited flavours. Improved with cooling
Chocolate (High cocoa %)
Low acidity; more bitter than Coffee B but not bitter enough to rank as a 4. Darker roast than Coffee A or D. Far more balanced than Coffee A, but not as much as Coffee B.
Not offensive, but no chocolatey or caramel flavors jump out at me. Just sort of flat. Nice mouth feel
Caramel, Apple
Less nutty than B
A lot like the George Howell but more acidic
More bitter and initially reminded me more of a darker roast. Can't quite discern a specific tasting note but would definitely be on my untrained palette.
dark chocolate, slight acidity. Wouldn't mind this as a daily go-to
Textured, tobacco or earthy, some spice, but also a really nice forward coffee cherry/red fruit note. Great balance of sweetness and texture. Was super confused until the blend was reveled. My personal favorite. Would love to try an espresso shot of this to really bring out the acidity on top of that texture.
wonderful body, fruit like cherries, light crab apple, blackberry hint, light rosewater, apple and pear. Smell is warm and inviting.
Chocolaty
sour then banana, nutty as it cooled
Neutral, nothing jumped out
Testured and thick mouth feel, earthy and almost dirty, gritty taste
More balanced when tasting backwards

Slightly fruity
Got better overtime.
not preferred, nutty smooth, walnut pith
Dark, smoky, dark chocolate
Grass, earthy
Actually bad coffee, No distinguishing notes
Deeper, very ‘medium’, nothing standing out
Earthy
Very balanced, as it cools it gets roasty
Reminds me of chiles.
I thought this coffee tasted the most balanced of the four in this test, at least to my tongue.  Despite learning post-taste that there was a rather unique blend of natural and wet hulled beans, I felt this was the most neutral-tasting of the bunch.

Harsh in the finish - last at all temperatures
Dark Choclate.
Honey, smokey, mild lemon
Wet hulled dark roast. Enjoyed despite my preference for light roast.
Balance of bitter and acidity, smokey
Nutty, Walnut
My preconceived notion of acidity and bitterness was confused. I think I gained an understanding during the tasting.
Hint of caramel taste note. But not a very pronounced tasting note for me.
Red fruit; caramel; raisin; dry; milk chocolate
bitter chocolate, dirt/earth
Just bad
Robusto?
Testured and thick mouth feel, earthy and almost dirty, gritty taste

I liked this one second best. Again felt like chocolatey notes to it with nice mouthfeel but not as much as with B

Ultra-clear, easy to drink, enjoyable but clarity without strong notes of any kind
Sour bourbon
Mellow, balanced
Easily the best of the bunch, very smooth, the most "Coffee" like of the options.

Robusta-y?
Roasty but light, some fruit - dark fruit?
Again, somewhat middle of the road. It's a lovely balanced cup, slightly more acidic than B, not bitter. Interesting, but I feel the proper description for me would be "inoffensive."
Thin watery texture. Not a flavor profile I like.
Most like a diner coffee. Solid and dependable
Chocolate ganache
Carmel, coca, thin
This felt the most balanced and I think others would like this the most but this has taught me I really don’t font like black coffee
Tasted less bitter as it cooled, improving
More bitter with each taste, definitely needs something to sweeten it up.
Yum
Fruitier chocolate, less intense
Sweet at the beginning
I really couldn't tell much of what was going on here. Tasted like the coffee that made me think I didn't like coffee.
Peaches, chocolate, maple syrup
Dark chocolate, changed a lot from sip to sip. At one point had a bad lingering aftertaste
Chocolate, molasses, apple
Basic diner coffee. Balanced.
Dark chocolate, plum
White grapes
Bitter aftertaste
Dark and wood notes
Idealized diner coffee
tart, meringue
Similar to B, a nice candidate for daily driver, but I'd put it just a bit lower. It felt less interesting to drink than B, although it was still fairly good overall.
Chocolate
Floral, jasmin, earthy, full body
Tangy, different but good. The more I drank the more I liked it
Dark and papery
Award for most standard, clean dark roast characteristics

Roasted notes but a little more balenced. Less distinct tasting ntoes
Normy, nothing distinct, but not thin, medium body?
savory
Harder to discern the notes
Chocolate and nutty notes. More “toasted” flavors. More “full” mouthfeel.
Fruitier
Cardamon, earthy spices
balanced nugget/caramel, full body, very comfortable/cozy to drink
More balanced... I guess cocoa
I can taste chocolate in this one.
Lactose, full body, weird. Kinda stinky dairy flavor
Weak
Nutty, similar to B
Nuttier. This one continues to get nuttier/earthy as it cools. 
My least favorite, but for my wife (a non-coffee drinker that dabbles in occasional flavored latte), it was “the best one”.
toast
Creamy chocolate
Smokey
smooth and balanced
most approachable of the coffees, inoffensive
At room temp:
-Low clarity
-Neutral; balanced
-No discernable notes
Chocolate, cocoa powder, puerh tea
I let these cool probably too much as I got pulled away so that may explain the variance in my notes. The more bitter than the previous ones, but enjoyable flavor
Comparatively mild, milk chocolate
Changed the most rapidly when the order of tasted coffee did, the flavour context. Medium roast? Some chocolate or more roasty- notes but also more acidity than b, and some floral notes.
Cool- fruit, balanced, caramel
Balanced for my preference. Mix of the brown flavors with a bit of fruit coming through.
Balanced between earthen and citrusy
Coffee, it’s what you ordered
Roasty, Nutty

Lightest flavor out of all the roasts
Earthiness, mushrooms, hint of brightness like balsamic vinegar
Lighter roast?  Nice.
Balanced

Familiar coffee taste, thicker mouth feel
It tasted fruity to me. It was fine, nothing that I really picked up from it.

Very neutral.  Not exciting as it's drinks like a  normal coffee.
typical coffee
Has the peanutty note not from roasting that I associate with Brazil or Papua New Guinea. Pretty distinctly my least favorite out of these but I know it's just my preferences and not because it's a bad coffee.
Light finish.
Nutty, but also tasted like gunpowder?
Mud water
cacao, raisin, molasses
earthy, light chocolate
Of the four, this one felt like the best "daily driver." Like, this is a coffee that would be a good house roast at a coffee shop or upscale diner. Well balanced, stayed enjoyable throughout the temperature range

Earthy
Biscuit
dark chocolate
very watery mouthfeel. neither good nor bad, kind of unremarkable verging on boring.
Hazelnut
“Clean” was the overwhelming thought. It reminded me of a generic coffee flavor, but done extremely well. A bitterness that didn’t overwhelm.  I would sip on this any day. Given a color, the flavor is clear, or maybe a light brown.
sweet, caramel, espresso, silky
Coffee
Nothing memorable
unsweetened caramel, chocolate. dark roast?
Cashew

Great balanced coffee. Good crowd pleaser
Very benign
A with less balls
A little chocolatey
Meh. I tasted a bit of fruit, sour and bitter notes and they were well balanced but there was something that just left me feeling underwhelmed. It felt a bit thin or liquidy to me, not in a good way
Ok so truthfully the cup fell over and the icy concentrate fell on the ground before we had this and we rinsed the puck off and tried accommodating the loss of concentrate by reducing the water added. That being said it was a very uneventful cup, didn't taste weak.
Very earthy, darker, smoky.
There really wasn't anything remarkable about this coffee. Like, it's good, but pretty middle ground.
Bland
Chocolate
Mixed flavors, soil, no flavor standing out alone
Herbatious, savory notes
Caramel. Mellow.
Somewhat earthy. The most "drinkable" of the four but also a little bit more "boring" than the others. Felt like this might be a go to for a daily driver
balanced
Very earthy.  Better tolerated when hot.
very subdued and chocolatey. nice but inoffensive and relative to the other coffees, somewhat boring.
Carmel
Reminded me of some teas I drink in terms of mouthfeel and a smidge in flavor.
Just pleasant overall. Nice smooth, chocolate
Eh
Did not prefer the bitterness level.
Approachable and chill for someone who is not a citrus coffee lover.
lighter texture, molasses, apples
I found this to be in between A and B in terms of flavor notes. Somewhat chocolaty and fruity but more sour. Lots of flavors to pick out but more acidic than I had wanted out of it.
Chocolate
caramel
Chocolate
Fermented Tang, BO, and Rubber

Smoky
Nicely balanced, roasted chestnut
I found this coffee rather flat and unremarkable during the tasting. Compared to the others I had a hard time picking out individual flavors.
Low body, fruity, slightly tea like
Well balanced
Felt less bitter than the previous to me, didn’t get a lot of specific flavor. Just kind of a medium body, medium tasting roast.
Thin. Milky sweetness.

After James' discussion: super interesting. Got much better, maybe due to temperature shift? Is this the best dark roast ever?
Apple
Floral
Rhubarb pie. Lighter, maybe watery
Middle of the road. Balanced?

Not my favorite, but OK
Peanut Butter
Tasted of chocolate, nutmeg, and cinnamon
Enjoyed both hot and cooled
When we tasted the cooled leftovers with whole milk, the spice notes still came through 
#1 preference with and without whole milk
Reminded me of diner coffee. Some strawberry in there and some molasses, but barely over the initial roughness.
Earthy, grassy; more bitter as cooled

Sweet, crisp, a bit of a berry
Very tasty
I had never tasted a wet hulled coffee before, so was pleased to have the chance. I liked the darker roast profile, it fits my normal roasting (I usually roast my own coffee). My own tastes are moving toward lighter roasts, so moving away from this style.
Pu'er tea
raisins, roasted nuts, toffee
smoky
Fuller body with earthy tones. Light finish, doesn't over stay.

At first didn't like this one, once cooled had very earthy flavor.
chocolate, hazelnut, jasmine
aftertaste has a hint of freeze dried strawberries; very low sourness, but with a faint note reminiscent of sulfuric acid though not unpleasant
Light flavor, high acidity compared to others (this one had cooled by the time I tried it)
As I was able to start discerning flavors from this, I tasted something that was more comforting but I couldn’t really tell what.
Green tea
More bitter but smooth, not much flavor
Neutral
Heavy, caramel and nutty
Very strong, bold flavor, more bitter than others, definitely hits you with a "punch" of bitterness at the very beginning, not a fan at all, this a flavor note that has turned me off of some more established supermarket coffees because of the that flavor, once it cooled noticed how much bitterness was there but could tolerate it more.
Kind of boring
Milk chocolate (but like the not so nice easter basket chocolate), very mild, doesn't taste like a whole lot
Clean and Unique flavor
Fruity, round. Note: I accidentally forgot to tare my scale and overdiluted.
orange peel, bright

Weak, some bitterness leads to slight roasty notes, burnt flavor.

it tastes like it came from a plant- not grassy or woody, just plant 
it tastes like it wants to be a milk drink (specifically latte vibes), but if it had milk it would be too milky
Vegetables
Cleaner. Most pleasant, acidic, no bitterness
Cereal, light
More bitter
Less sweet
A little bite but not unsmooth
Weaker as it cools
apple notes. clean finish. bitterness lingered the most with this one. this one also seemed to change the most as the taste testing continued which made it hard to nail down. very interesting.
Smokey and nutty
Heavy body, slight funk
When adding vanilla creamer it was the second best
Second best with creamer
initially had trouble telling this apart from coffee B, ended up preferring this for its texture, kind of chewy or like a brownie; I like this sort of coffee both black and in milk drinks, and it's similar to what I usually buy as beans to brew myself
The experience when tasting this blend largely varied dependent on which flavors preceded it in the lineup
Chocolate and nutty. Preference changed between this and B
Chocolate, lacks clarity
Green apple, leather
More bitter over time

Tasted dark and winey. Had a difficult time comparing C and B. They seemed to flip places on which I felt was more bitter and acid as I would sample between the two.
Buttery, mint/brightness, syrupy
Tropical fruit flavor (passion fruit and guava)
Feels like a more balanced version of Coffee A. The flavor isn't as punchy on the sip like coffee A and that's a good thing. The flavor builds after the sip and the aftertaste is quite pleasant. it holds up well to its taste as it cools too.

Lightest in flavor, very middle of the road, hard to pick up any distinct flavors
Round & balanced, changed least early on

Similar experience for me compared to the second coffee.
Savory and clear
Roasted nuts, Maillard sweetness
Notes of vegetables at first and developed into sweeter dried cherries
Most interesting and surprising in preference - very different from other coffees I usually drink but would surely drink again
creamy, smooth, balanced
This coffee was the most non-exciting coffee for me. It has a muddy mouth feel, and the flavors didn't wow me. Overall it was boring compared to the others in the lineup.
Dark chocolate, leather, oak
Not much to note for hot flavor; became muddy as it cooled
A little heavier, maybe a bit nutty

Smells great, sort of like a dessert aroma. Chocolate, vanilla, and creamy when warm. As it cooled, a bit more earthy. Foliage.
Pleasant, almost sweet.
Dark, woody, thin
Guessed origin: Ethiopia (half right)

Tastes like the most coffee coffee to ever coffee, diner coffee <33333

Very generic/boring
Balance milk chocolate and graham cracker
Bland in a good way. Chocolate notes? Could see myself drinking this with sugar & cream.
Tree bark
Nutty Flavor with acidic finish.
Brown sugar
The initial flavor reminded me of vanilla wafers, but the crispy cream filled type. Over time the feel of acidity lowered down to about a 3. Very intrigued by this one, came back to it many times.
Cherry
Overall not bad, but for me, this has a bit of an off note.  The fragrance is really quite nice, but there’s something I’d almost describe as a little dirty going on, arriving late in the flavor.  It’s in the background, but noticeable, and also seems to give this/or possibly emphasize a textural thinness.
Chocolate, nuts
Almond
Enjoyed this
Best of this test
Tangerine, cinnamon, black tea
Enjoyed the bitterness.
Dark roast immediately.  Kind of a chalky roast flavor if that makes sense.  Nice chocolate at the back end though. One of the best dark roasts I’ve had. But still my least favorite of the bunch.
Lots of bitterness, disliked even more as it cooled down. Chain diner coffee, almost. My least favorite of the bunch.
Mild, balanced. Warm
Banana bread (no nuts) and cereal squares
Chocolate, cola. Some darker notes on the nose, some of which I find off putting.
Good every day coffee
Floral, least clear of all the coffees

Low Body
More Herbaceous
Something spicy, such as clove
This one got better as it cooled and I would happily drink this in the full rotation.
Cocoa powder, smoke, fig jam, syrupy and full body
Astringent, burt, and earthy. This reminds me of every disappointing cup of coffee I've ever had from Peet's.
More spicy or woody. Darker but not as dark as B.
1, easily a 1. On re-taste. There’s a drying paper quality as it cools that comes in the finish with an unpleasant bitterness. Not commodity dark roast, still specialty but not great. 

Earthy
Heavy, lingering, full

Nutty
didnt really taste much
Not much depth, low acidity, med/dark, apricot
Smooth muted flavor, best smell
Not my favorite. Dark roast for sure. It doesn't taste substantially different than my grocery store's (WinCo) Rocket Java beans.
I thought I was gonna like this, but as the coffee got cooler, I got more and more of a burnt taste, almost like a Smokey cigar.
Fruity
Woody/earthy
Couldn't get a good read on this one, but it felt very one dimensional
Too vegetabley and earthy
I didn’t get a lot of specific notes from this one
Fruity
Cherry, also had a hard time getting much out of this one. Definitely informed flavors of A and D though.
Nutty, acid
Brown sugar, mild sweetness, earthy?
As Cooled: Bitterness increase, acidity decrease
Tasting Notes: Buttery Walnut, Cinnamon, Milk Chocolate
Mouth Feel: Medium high
IPA
Floral
Good finish.
Floral
Straw, dirty, complex
Got more acidic, bitterness went down

well balanced, almond and apricot
berry and tea
Dark chocolate, sweet lemon, thick mouthfeel

Fudgey, Stonefruit, Blackberry
Berries
Saltwater
Chocolate
Caramel

Current
citrus? thickest
Neutral, chocolaty, my wife's favorite
Grain
Veggie
Neutral
Dark roast
Caffeine aversion, not a coffee drinker. Palette not refined for coffee. This was my favorite of the 4. Not bitter, not highly acidic. Tastes slightly vanilla, but easy.
tobacco
like my usual coffee, less fruity, good
citerus, lemon?
Milk chocolate
Smokey possibly fig
Not a big fan
I like it less than b but I can’t put my finger on it. Maybe cause it’s further from the dark chocolaty roasty flavors.
It did get more fruity as it cooled down, but still tasted sour to me. Reminded me of grapefruit a little.
Slight bitter aftertaste. Green apple.
Roasty, cocoa
I started off disliking this almost as much as D, but it started to feel more preferred as I compared it in different orders and had the best aftertaste
Chocolate. Astringent. Tobacco.
Smooth mouth feel. Cherry.
Heavy mouth fill, less complexity of flavor
Harsh flavors here that I wasn’t a fan of, almost tastes poorly brewed with its acidity and bitterness. A bit vegetabley.
Tart, rhubarb
More bitter than the other coffees.  But still pretty balanced and smooth.  Tastes a bit like barley tea.  This coffee was the best with some light cream.
balanced, smooth, heavy, full bodied
Cola nut, green pepper, dark chocolate
toasted nut, bakers chocolate, mole, slightly savory , heavier body
Felt the most balanced in terms of overall flavour, was notably enjoyable after it cooled down
Savory
The bitterness actually grew as the coffee cooled for me, while the acidity seemed to almost ride a sine wave from low to moderate to low again thru the test. I thought this may be a rather inoffensive medium roast and was surprised to learn that it was darkly roasted.
Citrusy, floral, earthier finish notes
Bittersweet chocolate
fruity?
bitter and hollow. chocolate, roasted nut, tiny hint of apricot on cooling. lots of roast and ash
Sweet,
Caramel, and maybe a bit of something earthy or mineral like slate. Got a little fruit as it cooled. Med-hi mouthfeel.

Very muted and bland between B and D
earthy
grassy, bread, oat
Hay, stale
Floral
Nice balance - chocolatey
Hibiscus, pear
Balanced and mild, easy to drink
Heavy mouthfeel. Syrupy sweet. Hate the flavor.
I have heard. Offer described as tea like many times but this is one of the first times I ever really got it.

Smoky, I get some Christmas spice and a pleasant sourness that makes my mind think of cranberry sauce (although I don’t know that I would describe the taste that way). Red berry may be accurate 

It had no one flavor that stuck out super strong but I liked that, I feel that it is a blend but a blend I would love to have.
earthy, dark
Hints of chocolate
Pepper, fresh wood
Floral, porter
This one was my favorite. I thought it was well rounded, not overly better. It was very enjoyable. My friend and I enjoyed the second capsule of this with milk right after we finished the tasting.
Watery, very thin, underripe blackberry, smooth
The perfect “coffee house” coffee. Smooth, no bitterness, bright flavor.
Cereal earthy
Solid all around coffee
Middling when it comes to mouth feel, taste was good but uninteresting to me.
not much
Smooth - buttery finish
The best balanced to me. Would probably be more of an afternoon choice, some chocolate on the back.
floral, bright, citrus, salty
Earthy
Caramel corn, full bodied
My Favorite - with "A" a close second.
Med. Bodied and balanced with notes of woody, suede, citris (lemon)
Middle of the road, fruits, got more bitter as it cooled.
Had a hard time with notes.  Smooth, balanced, coffee!

Chocolate, orange, light bodied, dry finish
Caramel
BBQ pork
Chocolate
Citrus
Some blackberry notes
fruity
Nutty
sandy, light,
most bitter, dark chocolate
When too hot, this was absolutely insipid. Evolved with time though to show roast notes I expect in “good” coffee.
caramel, milk chocolate
Chocolate, Earthy
This experience informed me that I have no understanding of what bitterness and acidity feel like in coffee.
Smooth; roasty; classic
butterscotch
Coco powder, grapefruit, least clarity
stout beer
Pretty good; I liked it
cocoa
Grape, smoke
Woody, muted
bitter and acidic
I did not like this :( 
As it cooled, the bitterness went down, but when I drank this hot, the bitterness + dark roast was pretty much all I noticed. 
I'm not super well versed in the type of coffee that this is? I think James mentioned Sumatra or something like that and he said that the way that the coffee was processed resulted in a taste that was quite divisive so maybe that is also playing a factor into why I didn't like that cup.
wood, almond
Nutty, woody
Sweet, Earthy, Dark, Chocolate
Smokey, tobacco, earthy. Mid clarity
chocolatey, medium body
Fruity, full bodied
Bold, bitter, lingering acid/fruit, dark chocolate, almond

Maybe some stone fruit and nut notes. Pistachio? Also keeps changing as it cools. I am confused
medium, confusing
Richer
Chocolate covered almonds/almond skin
Sour apple
Dark
Kind of chocolatey. Well balanced flavor.
the most generic coffee (exactly what I'd expect before I knew much)
Lacked punch for me. No bite. Almost a "hot brown water" experience. Really didn't taste of anything to me either hot or cold. Could not enjoy it.
Roasty, Earl Gray tea
most roasty, better as it cools
Cherry
"brighter", more interesting flavor. more "berry" or coffee fruit.
Fruity and juicy. Clean mouth feel
Malt, cereal, thin
chocolate
There is a tasting note that reminds me of red rocket ale.
Rich, milk chocolate, black tea like
Smokey
Cherry, Creamy
Not sure about this one too
This one is probably my favorite. Similar to Coffee A in smell, but more subtle and less tangy than A. Fruity aftertaste.
Coffee
Nutty
nutty, smokey
Skim texture, Darker, chocolate notes
Parsley flower
Bergamot
Nutty
If I was serve this in a diner, I would think that it was really good diner coffee. That was a sense that we had when we were doing the tasting. If I got it in a third wave shop, I'd be disappointed, but in a diner it would be a pleasant surprise.
slightly burnt notes, not unpleasant though.
Fruity
More sour fruit
Round, fatty
Balanced. Low acidity. Berries. Full bodies.
bright, pleasant sourness and bitterness.
Berry, Orange
Tastes only of roast to me, as I usually feel about dark roasts, not sure why they even bothered to pick interesting beans if they are going to then burn them.
Not much flavor apart from bitterness while warm. Burnt sugar notes when cool. I liked it much better cool.
Pineapple and milk chocolate
stonefruit cacao
buttery feel, fermenty in a negative way
Mute, just a touch of sweetness on the tail end
Slightly too bitter for my preference, earthly
tiramisu, generic

Closest to what I expect coffee to taste like but was still a bit too different from what I normally drink. Reminded me of better hotel coffee.

Very balanced.
Thick, oily, round, vanilla, coconut
hazelnut, smoked fruit
Char, earthy, dirt
Smoky, woody, hickory

just alright
herby, fruity, lemon-sour mouth feel

First taste was favorite but as the tasting went on I ended up not liking it as much.
Tastes boring. Melts on tongue
Black tea, dark fruit
Smoky, hints of smooth chocolate
Less boring than b, still boring.  Got better as is cooled though
Flat
dark chocolate
Chocolatey
Metallic finish, burnt notes
Floral
Milk chocolate and much brighter after tasting coffee A. Maybe some spice flavor. Very balanced.
A well balanced cup.  I found it to be enjoyable and if I weren't so deep in the enjoyment of bright, fruity and floral coffees at the moment, I could see myself drinking this as a break between the extremes that are out there today.
Washed, woody, black tea
Velvety mouthfeel.
Warm, comfort flavours.
Velvety mouth feel, plummor grapes, buttery biscuit or croissant

Round and chocolaty
Lovely, but not my favorite I've ever had.
second favorite, liked the smoothness

smooth and calm
Balanced, earthy, cacao, prune, toast
It was a tossup between equator and George Howell. Favored  Equator first but  at first but-as it cooled George inched ahead.
tastes like weak coffee, brown
Nutty
Apple
Good balance of bitterness and acidity. Flavorful
Same. Didn't taste a lot of anything.
Fruity, like cranberry?
Nondescript. Nuts? Graham cracker?
hops, green tea
Seemed weak and watered down. No backing or punch. An utterly emotionless coffee.
A little acid, a little bitter
Black currant
earthy, barely chocolate, somewhat muddy feel, good everyday coffee for dark drinkers
Nutty
red fruit, jam, sweet
Few redeeming qualities
A bit less character than I would like, but pretty good. Chocolatey and slightly fruity.
Tannic, grape peel, caramel
also celery?  maybe dark chocolate?
lemon
Very balanced, melon, Graham cracker, thicker, stone fruits, vanilla
Bright and nutty
Earthy, balanaced
No clear notes for me on this one.
Chocolatey
Earthy, tea, thin
Unoffensive, roasty, diner coffee
grassy, wheat, neutral
Rich honey flavor paired with baker’s chocolate and marzipan. Medium roast, medium body, medium clarity.
Best of the balanced coffees (B & C). Still a little less adventurous for my taste, but not bad.
Nutty, balanced, smooth
coconut
Very bland for my taste. Undecided between a 2 and 3 but ultimately felt it wasn't very either way.
Compared to A and B, this is what I could drink full cup. Not my favorite though.
I liked this more as I drank it than I would have expected after the first sip.
Balanced, dark? Not a ton jumps out. Guessed a blend of Colombia and Central America
nutty, chocolate
Chocolate
i almost rated this higher than coffee B because its bitterness gave it more personality, but, after taking more drinks i think its harder to enjoy the cup after awhile. Covers my palate with bitter.
Smooth, caramel
muted, tropical, balanced
Marshmallow, Pear, almond, vanilla
I wanted to like this one, but there was a paper/wood/cereal note that kept throwing me off.
Lingering bitterness that resembles burnt clutch aroma. No sweetness or smoothness to offset that bitterness. Yuck
Heavy mouth feel
balanced
Roasty, nut
cereal, honey, banana
berry, jam
Feels like the daily driver coffee, chocolate
Roasty, caramel
Most bitter in the tasting.
Grassy, tobacco? Notes were unclear and hard to distinguish

Sweet like brown sugar, full bodied like a good diner coffee

couldn't decipher
earthy, light, tart
If I were to have this regularly, I would be inclined to add some sort of cream.
Darker notes, bark, chocolate, bitter/dry
I had a hard time tasting this one, some cherry in the back end, it gets watery as it cools, maybe some cinnamon?
Cocoa
Strong. Chocolate. Thick.
Strawberry
similar to 1, easy to drink, roastier
hints of chocolate
Honey
Apples
Balanced
Sour
Chocolate
Sweetness, like caramel or sweetened condensed milk.
Bad roasted coco
Dark chocolate, texture
Roasty, caramel
Very nice, I could drink thos regularly
Balanced level of acidity and bitterness. Roasty flavors, not overpowering.
This to me was similar to B, this had a little extra something going on.  Again mellow and pleasant but a more unique flavor.  This is my favorite of the 4. Would drink this any time of day, black or with milk
Smooth
Sesame/nuttier notes. Seems slightly darker roasted but with some acidity still
Low acidity and darker roasted. Nuttier notes
Mouth feel: textured, full bodied, as if metal filtered rather than paper filtered. Earthy, peaty, notes of leather and wood.

Gross and bitter
Similar to B
Pretzel
Heavy, full bodied
Meaty/umami at first
Chocolate at the end
smooth; full mouthfeel
Burnt wood, cherry, tomato BBQ sauce, citrus, light texture (this one tasted like good American bbq with a a tomato-based sauce and a sweet tea. Don’t ask)
Not interesting in the middle of the tasting but loved this one after cooling down a bit
Reminds me of really good diner coffee
Almond, nut
Little burnt
caramel, toasted nut, chocolate
Nutty, full body, chocolate, slight fermentation
Caramel, light, clears tongue quickly, chocolate
Dark chocolate, some fruity note at the end which I cannot distinguish
Nutty
Very sweet, low bitterness. An excellent cup of coffee.
Was just okay, easy to drink but did not get many tasting notes out of it
Despite being low on my personal preference scale for this tasting, it was clearly still a good coffee. Simply darker and less balanced than what I prefer.
"brown", the flavor was probably the most neutral and only minimally helped with milk and sugar
More bitter and roasty, less fruity
Tobacco
Somewhat burnt electronic taste, not sure how to describe, as it cools.
First coffee I tried and it was pleasant it did have a a fruity bite but I didn't hate it it wasn't tart
Nice round balance
toast
Nice, bright and fruity. Would love for my daily cafe to serve this
taste like regular coffee
Woody, chocolate, nutty, smooth.
Lighter, scored differently hot vs cold
Tastes like a hike
Well balanced blend, could see myself enjoying this as a milk based espresso drink
Mild fruitieness
cocoa
Tea, raspberry

Slightly 'green', caramel
This was a very good, standard cup of coffee. If I wanted a regular coffee that's nothing special but comforting, this would be it.
Earthy and smoky
Woody, breakfast tea, astringent
Balanced ,taste like coffee, nuts
Standard cup of American hotel coffee
Burnt rubber initially, more pleasant as it cooled, some fruits

Reminds me of McDonald’s Drip Coffee.
Chocolate
Chocolate, medium body
Tart cherry; kind of an oily, mechanic shop taste, but in a good way
motor oil
Doesn’t seem too strong, almost like a tea
Accidentally added an additional 20g of water
Apple
Dry feel, acidity grew for me?
Didn't notice much in this one, bland
Chocolate
very enjoyable
Less mouthfeel than B. Roasty, chocolatey,  amistad vegetal but thin
Light body, nutty, toffee, dark chocolate
graham cracker
Chocolate
woody, ashy, a little juicy, warming bitter finish
Even cheaper dark chocolate. Like with the white crust, from a gas station

Something strange, super fruity/berry notes. Too acidic and fruity for me.
Sweet, yogurty, smooth, fruity, reminds me of kefir
Reminds me of taste of sour cherries/raspberries, almost herbal/medicinal
Fermented!
A nice, modern cup of fruity coffee. Very light body
Stone fruit, kiwi
Very fruity, raspberry. Probably a natural or maybe even a more involved processing method.

Fruit - berries, strawberries, hint of fermented funk.
apple
love this coffee, but someone had it right in the chat-- the friend you love seeing at a party but would hate to be your roommate. Drinking a cup of this black on a cool day would be novel and wonderful, but this will never be a daily driver.
Berries, berries, berries

i frequent black and white and this fruitiness is why i love them so much. so berry notes and a subtle sweetness with low bitterness

Like the perfect cup of diner coffee
Fermented Fruit Flavor, Raspberry, Very Juicy
Heavy and fruity, reminds me of mead
Berries
Bright, fruity, juicy
Less acid than A, but the second most.

This is my favorite. It tastes funkier, more natural processed which I prefer

It has fruit, blackberry and blueberry notes
Apple, grape
Very, very different from the other coffee options. It smells the most floral to me. I really didn't like it when it was hot, but tolerated more as it cooled because the acidity went down. Has a lot of fruit notes in it.
Sour, tasted very different from the others
Blueberry
Woody, fruity, berries
Huckleberry/blueberry, slightly velvety mouthfeel, bright, Ethiopian
sour, creamy texture, berry flavors
Heavy fruit, crisp apple, chocolatey finish, less acid as it cooled
Orange, fermented, apple
Berries, chocolate
Until James pointed it out I really felt those fruity flavors meant acidity, but comparing to A you can really see how it is all fruit with very little acid.  Keeping honest with my answers though.
blueberry pie, way too sweet/sour, hate these types of coffee
Red berries, Christmas, bright fruit notes, wine
By far the most complex out of all the four coffees. Very fruity, especially at the start, but persisting as it cools, along with the introduction of a sort of "candy"-like tone. Moderate acidity, not as much as Coffee A. My personal favorite, though I am inclined towards more acidic/fruity coffees
Interesting fruity notes, has a pleasant sour quality
Blueberry, maple syrup. This one tasted like pancakes in a cup, it was delicious
I was very perplexed by this one. Each time I went back to it I was left tasting something new and that was fascinating to experience. However, overall nothing I tasted really struck me as enjoyable.
overripe huckleberry. 
fruit tea
Sweet, chocolatey finish

Much more pronounced tang/funk that gets mellowed out by being less bitter than C, brings out the fruit/citrus aspect more – same general mouthfeel/texture as C
Fruity -- apple and pear.

Blueberries and citrus!
Fruity, Juicy, Bright, Berries, Funky

Not very bitter and very fruity, least coffee tasting of the bunch (little roast flavors), blueberries
Orange and blueberry

Interesting but I don't like it.
apple
Very interesting, i liked the complexity and high notes of fruit. Really got a berries and chocolate notes to it
Raspberry, orange, rose water
Blueberry
Fruity
Thickish mouthfeel, orange (?), earthy tasting, a heavier version of Klatch. I would probably choose this as an occasional coffee to swap out the Klatch when I needed more "wake up power" in the morning.  Takes my normal half and half with turbinado well without being overwhelmed but doesn't really change the taste.
Sour candy
Bright fruit
Floral
Tea
Sour
Aftertaste
Clear, Citrus, Low Body
Strong Fruit, Blueberry
Blueberries, fruity, very light, almost tea like
Very fruity, but not one type of fruit.  Lots of different flavors.  Sometimes chocolate was present.  A fairly even mix of bitterness and acidity.  A very complex flavor which actually I did not enjoy due to the constantly changing notes.  The coffee is very interesting, but seems like it's trying to do too much as opposed to doing 1 or 2 things very well.
green apple - high acid, but with more balance. Better and rounded out as it cooled.
noticed strong notes of blueberry
Overwhelmingly fruity
Too sour cherry
Medium body, dark chocolate taste and smell

Favorite of the bunch. Especially as it cooled.
Possible natural process, melon, berry, lite floral, lite fermenty, maybe a little winey.
Fermented fruit
Citrus, Lemon
Red fruits and chocolate. Probably the only one I liked at all
Lime acidity. Cherry
Strong fruit, particularly blueberry. The most distinct flavor of the 4.
Very fruity. Probably the most preferable to me in a cortado/flat white. Would probably be my second favorite if I drank it black to A, but I don't really prefer to drink black coffee so that's not really a deciding factor for me.
I hate this one!
Sour, fermented, dry, very dark cocoa
Strong non juicy sour note
Ripe fruit, less clear than A.
very strong unripe fruit
Fermented, anaerobic
A little harsh, more bitter and acidic than the others.
Vinegar, wine
Kinda olivey flavor, very fruity
Distinct berry flavor. Very much like blueberries or huckleberries.
Raspberry, Sweet, Rooibos
Blackberries, sweet, tart

Fruity, cherries, bark, floral
Tropical, fruit
Currant, strong body, heavy finish
I knew this was special from the moment I started adding water to the cup! I got a big blast of berries even before I was finished filling the mug. Got blueberries reminiscent of a single origin Ethiopian from the East Harrar ... or perhaps a good Sidamo. As it cooled I got pronounced apples. This was delicious. It was the only cup I chose to finish this morning.

Fermented fruit
Complex
Blueberry at the front, very fruity, very fun and complex. My favorite coffee from all of them, these guys definitely care and do amazing work
This one was the most interesting of the four. At first, I thought it tasted like chicory coffee but then realized it tasted like another coffee I tried a while back: https://www.drinktrade.com/colombia-monteblanco-passion-fruit-washed/p/3845 This isn't a good everyday drinker for me but I like that it's something different.

Love how complex / different this tasted. Very similar to A for me.
Bright, cherry, fruity, tangy
I don't dislike fermenty-funky, but this is a bit much, raspberry, sweet fruit, slight milk chocolate, natural, would have guessed it was Ethiopian, more complex and longer evolution/better finish as it cools, but still funkier than I prefer
Smokey
Dried fruits
Apple, Strawberry
Tropical fruit, citrus
Very sweet, almost chocolatey
berry bright
Extremely light, lacking body
raspberry, caramel, blueberry
Lemon Square, Red Grape (as it cools), Sweet Tea, floral finish and wonderfully light mouth feel. D is soo good it is so hard to say that A is better, its a tie!
I also really liked this one. A bit more balanced than A but similarly bright and juicy. Less sour.
Fruit, juicy, very sweet. Starburst?
Blackberry, sour and tangy
Raspberry, cereal or malty sweetness
Fascinating and unwraps nicely over time

Has that blueberry taste I associate with ethiopian coffees, maybe like banana?

I really like this, but of course I’m addicted to anaerobic natural coffees, so this was easily identifiable for me. Thought it was Ethiopian, but surprised to see it was Colombian.

Notes of blueberry and strawberry. Slightly too bitter with drying mouth feel (like red wine).
Blueberry bush
Most bitter, most mouthfeel
clearly a natural - interesting - tea like. If it wasnt so interesting id say id prefer a fuller body
Reminded me of the smell of smoked meat somehow lol. Intense, slightly salty
Bright. Lemony. Sharp. Most drinkable. Reminds me of how I take my tea.
Funky! tropical fruits, mango, blackberry - this was my second favorite, a "special occasion coffee" but I don't think I'd want to drink it every day.
Berries
Apple, black currant
Juicy
Fruity! Had me fooled for an Ethiopian. By far my favorite
Fruity, well balanced

Delightful and surprising; fruity but not super bright.
Floral, red grape, lychee
Sweet apple
Honey crisp apple
I think that I interpreted the fermented flavors as acid. My immediate reaction was that it had a sort of vinegar taste to it. It remained my least favorite also after I added oat milk.
Blueberry
Very fruity. Overripe mangos and durian.
Sour green currants . wine acidic mouth feel like a white wine
Fruit, berries, passion fruit, light, bright
Smells like cayenne, tart cherry, cocoa nibs
1st impression: yucky
Overall: gross undertones
2nd round: still yucky
Loved it, very fruity.  Reminds me of many of Tsukikoya’s coffees in Japan (which I thoroughly enjoyed when living down the street from them)
This might just be my inability to taste well, but I found my taste buds blown out by what I thought was bitterness in this one.  That might have just been my surprise by it, and there was actually more acidity, but all I got was mushroom and earth flavors, and I did not find that pleasant.
Blackberry! Some fermented flavor too. Similar to A. Light. More acidic as it cooled.
Tons of fruit.
very sour (too sour), not too bitter
Apples, light

Blueberry for days.
Way too acidic
Berry, high clarity
Vegetable changing to dark chocolate
Fruity pebbles. Intense berry and tropical fruit notes. Fermenty. Likely Natural process. Ethiopia vs Colombia.  This one is almost too wild for me (and I usually love naturals).
Blueberry, fermented, soft and vibrant, tropical, lightest mouthfeel
I have a hard time distinguishing between acidity and bitterness. I never drink coffee without a small amount of half and half, which probably goes a long way to neutralize both bitterness and acidity. Also, I don’t like cool coffee, so my scores are based almost entirely on when the coffee was very hot.
Blueberries and other small bush-growing berries.  Tea-like.  Light and bright.
No bitterness change over time and a mild increase in acidity (4 to 4.5).
Lots of fruit to almost sour with natural ‘fermented’ funky smell but good balance.
Fruity, acid, delicious, bright, fruit bunches
apple, lemmon
Blueberries when hot, burnt? Apple cider that's starting to go off, lemon rind 


Below I noted this as my favorite, but after James revealed tasting notes, somehow coffee a started to taste better? Or maybe a is better cold and a hot. I still recorded my original scores though
Again, I seem to have reversed bitterness and acidity in my tasting, so consider those results to be backwards. this coffee is sharp and distinctive, but the distincitve taste is one I do not like very much. so it is ranked number 3. Maybe I’d like it after having it for a while; tastes do change.
Red berries, stonefruits, bright, wine, chocolate
Complex and fruity. Fun to drink.
Fermented, Blueberries, Pear, Sweet
Chocolate, wine, pine
Acidic
Too fruity. Reminded me of flavored coffee, which I dislike
Blueberries, light texture
Berry
Citrus
Great sweetness, tangy when cooled, blueberry, balanced acidity.
First sip tasted like rancid fruit. Better as it cooled more like red berries and reads more like Ethiopian. The way the taste test was set up I figured it was anaerobic before I tasted it.
Too fruity and the fruitiness emphasize acidity more than it actually it is.
Blueberry
Sour
earl grey, lime, guava
burnt caramel, berry, Newcastle Brown Ale
This is not a coffee I would reach for as an every day cup. It is the one that changed the most throughout the tasting. Some sips I loved as they reminded me of hot spiced cider, and then others strayed too far into the acidity range and I lost some of the complexity. I would have to spend a lot of time with this coffee to fully come to terms with my feelings on it, however I am not sure if I want to...
Ooh, so fun! Smells bright and acidic, very berry taste, perhaps blueberry?, almost tea-like, enjoyable and unexpected!
Balsamic vinaigrette
Tastes like salmonberries at the beginning of the season, and cloudberries at the end of the season in Alaska. Like a badly pected mushy cherry jam.
Boozy
Grape
Round
Fermented
 Fruity
Bright apple/pear at first, opened into more of a candied fruit juice. Very juicy as things cooled down.
Berries, blackberry or blueberry, and very sweet. Absolute favorite.
First note, I have covid, my taste is a bit skewed. This one immediately hit me with a fruity flavor, the acidity started to fad as it cooled.
intense tropical citrus
Lemon, juicy
Divisive, got better as it cooled
strangely disliked this one.  watery? left a long taste that felt off.

Dark chocolate and bing cherries. Wasn't that into this one. I liked it better hot, so I think I'm probably not a fan of the nuances of the flavor.
Chocolate & grape. Very balanced.
Sweet, blueberry
Wood. Cherries.
Probably the most interesting of all of them because of the unique taste.  Wasn't my taste, but I liked that it seemed polarizing.
funky, fermeted, tropical
Fruity, cherry, bright
Very sour. Reminds of the way rotten fruit smells. Kind of sickly sweet? Hate it. I'd give it a 0 for preference if I could. Do not like.
Tangy, fermented, candy sweetness, blueberry, watermelon
Stonefruit, good mouthfeel, pulpy, juicy, funky, plumy, dark chocolate, anaerobic weirdness
Lots of fruit notes, thin tea-like body
Fruity with a harsh initial bite that rounds out as it cools

Raspberry, vinegar, floral, ale(?)
Raspberries, sugar cookies
Lightly bodied but very complex. I (incorrectly) guessed this was an Ethiopian.
Clear experimental processing. Raspberry and graham cracker hot. Floral, medium bodied.

Favorite to taste but probably not an everyday coffee.
Very fruit forward. Higher acid. Complex.
Fruity and tangy, got Hawaiian Kona country vibes from this:
bitter, strong
By the end, this became very strange (like A), but finding out they were lightly roasted explains the acidity in it and why it was so strange for me.
Tastes like olives, like wood
Clean, bright and fruity. Notes of pear and cranberry.
Colombian coffee, struggled to determine complexity, reminded me of good quality coffee from grocery store.
Wild berries, cereal maltiness
Fruity, nice finish

Fermented black cherry
Strong fermented berry flavor, very little profile drift as it cooled. No roasty flavors or bitterness detected
Lightest texture, almost fermented flavors
Fruity, fermented. Preferred the taste more as it cooled. Clarity became higher as it cooled- almost overwhelming to palette when hot.
Fruity 
Clarity - 4

At first thought to be quite acidic until compared with coffee A, has a distinct fruity tang, and fits the flavor profile I would usually like but can't figure out why I don't
VERY juicy and fruity, lots of complex flavors going on. quite the contrast from C and a very difficult choice to decide which i like better. i'll pick D as my overall favorite just because of the fun and unique experience it brought me
Like a dulled version of coffee A with a bit more richness.

Apple, Grape, Tart
Light bodied; flavors of pear, elderflower, and lime.
Blackberry, bright, expected Ethiopian
Blueberries, nice mouth feel
Initially very high acidity with little to no bitterness. Very fruity coffee. Bitterness came in as it cooled and balanced the cup, yet still remained acidity and juicy.
This one tasted the best for me because it was the least bitter and heavy. It didn't make me gag!
complex, citris, grapefruit, unsweet blueberry, lays on palate, changes a lot as cool, not like it

I found this to taste like a more mellow version of Klatch. I could drink this routinely as it's not quite so extreme in any of its qualities.

Very fruity, Ethiopian.    Almost like a fruit wine.    Not sure what fruit I would call this, strawberry compote?
Like clementines & sugar & acid.
Tart apple
At first I said fruit juice, but later changed that to hibiscus tea. Other flavors, raspberry, blood orange
Mango. Spice.  It got much better as it cooled.
Lime, fruit juice, vanilla
Changed the most as it cooled, very bright and fruity (citrus and apple) to start, more nutty and complex as it cooled.
Modern citrus scotch. Note my cup of tea.
- red wine reduction, vinegar, floral
- most interesting
- like klatch but ALSO NOT?!?!?
- this has the vinegar more than C, makes sense because there is some washed in the C blend but it's different. they let this one see the sun. single origin. all that
Orange, dates, sugar cane
I don't like acidity
personal favorite. I really thought this was their "Gamatui Natural" Ugandan origin.

Semi-sweet
Very similar to coffee A
Blueberry, mango
Harsh, lingers heavy mouthfeel dark chocolate slight fruity notes,fig ,once it's cooled gets a little better still holds a very fermented flavor that I don't particularly enjoy with this as opposed to something like whiskey. It's a very acquired taste that I'll have to drink more of to get used to it.

Probably throw in sugar or cream to cover up those flavors and would use as a last resort.
Very clearly naturally-processed, lots of fermented and tropical vibes.
fruity, blueberries
Banana, citrus, juicy, bright, lots of various fruit notes
All I could taste was fruit, berries and citrus with a bit of insect repellent, overwhelming aftertaste (a bad one)
Burnt beans- in a good way, blackberry notes a little hint of sour apple that lingered
Fruity but in a bad way.
strong fruit flavor
Fruity and citrusy flavors and smell; immediate bitterness but after bitterness subsides the flavor has a lot of clarity; immediate bitterness isn’t as strong when cool. Most interesting to taste.
High texture, rough, and aggressively flavored, feeling both acidic and bitter strangely. Notes are dark chocolate, lemon, and NYC deli coffee.

slight fruit, less acidic than A
blue berry, mango
Extremely clear and bright! Tasted notes of blueberry and fruit. If I wanted a coffee that had fun flavors, kind of like a good tea, I'd choose this.
Floral, fruity
This one was very very sour.  I think James mentioned a fermentation?  That sounds like something I would want to try, but now I might avoid it.
favorite, malty & chocolate notes
Compost
WOW. ALL the acid. It tastes EXACTLY like a chocolate covered strawberry. Ok. I reall like this, but I couldn't drink it every day. It's like a fruit juice. Wild.

Berries, fermented fruit/wine, honey.
green grape
Quite sour, and a bit bitter. Extremely fruity, sour or fermented fruit. Could not quite put my finger on what fruit exactly, maybe a blackberry, or something tart. To me it was the most complex flavor-wise but not something I can drink a whole cup of.
Berries
VERY FRUITY. My high Acidity score is most likely from just how fruity it is, not necessarily the true acidity. Fruity into sweetness and slight pleasent bitterness. This one got more bitter as it cooled.
Cherries, bright, consistent, distinct
Bitter, pithy
Apple, Blueberry, Dry, Clarity
Unsure of the bitterness/acidity really…this was my 2nd favorite aroma, and is sweet. Somewhat berry or cherry-like.
Fruity light roast smell,
Currant,
Prune,
Sugar
Fruity. Blueberry. Mango. Fermented.
I liked this the best at the first taste, but after several tastings it was my least favorite.
Fruit punch, cherry, plum, fermented.
Sour fruit / sour candy
Veggie broth, very interesting, least coffee like.
Light mouth feel, apple, pear, bright, fermented, mango, cranberry
Could tell it was a natural process immediately. Just tons of fruit immediately and almost alcoholic.
sharp berry fruitiness
Fruity, clean, light
Too sour for me. Fermented fruit describes it perfectly
Lots of texture, lots of fruitiness, bright
Fermented, sour, fruity
Fruity, blueberry, juicy
Fruit, Natural, Blackberry?, Blueberry, well balanced
Fruity notes are very strong, floral, full bodied non hollow and very well balanced
Cocoa nibs, pastry
Bright, Pear, Blueberry
Gogi berry, sumac tea.
Weird flavor funky fermented gamey gooseberry
Very fruity
Floral, citrus and herb, cocoa, sweet
Citrussy, sour, funky
Chocolate/dried cherry
Alcohol
Fruity. Mellows as it cools.
Natural, cherry
Unpleasantly sour with no body and a weird aftertaste.
Apple, fermenty, tropical fruit
This tastes like fermented coffee. It almost has that sort of barrel aged/fermented sour fruit note to it. I;rs interesting but not my favorite.
Juicy ripe red fruits and cooked jammy berries, some citrus, honey
Tasted like nothing I’ve tasted before while hot, incredible! Mellowed out and was very difficult to pick a preference between A and D as it cooled. Fruity and like a desert, like a fruit salad.
Naturally processed 
Fruity, blueberry, almost like fruit punch

Origin: Ethiopia
Better once cool
Juicy, smooth, floral
Blackberry tea. Fruity but not acidic. Very unique coffee.
Sweet Fruit; juicey; fermentation.
Hints of acidity without pepper and cherry without sourness.
Most noticeable acidity of the four, and the most pronounced flavor profile. Sour apple candy. I really didn't like it at first taste, but liked it more as it cooled and I tasted it more (my initial preference score was a 1, then a 2, then finally the 3 I settled on). I still think I liked Coffee C more, but this is the one I feel I'd be most likely to buy again. Definitely the biggest difference from any coffee I've tried before, and the most interesting of the four.
funky, tropical, mango, mild pineapple acidity
Fermented fruit
Fruity, fermented notes - what I'd expect from someplace offering a ton of single origins. Enjoyable cup of coffee in an exploring what's available sense, but absolutely not what I'd want for a daily drinker.
Fermented, blueberry, Cherry, Complex. Most balanced out of the group. Don't make me choose between A or D!
Fruity, funky
Cherry
dark chocolate, nice aftertaste, burnt
strong smell (olives, vinegar), citrus
Sour, Fruity
Medium body, originally disliked the most - but became most interesting, Fruity - especially blackberry & apple, fairground apple & cinnamon and sweet - like a candy apple, some smoke peaking at medium temp
Molasses
Acidic coffee, but not as much as Coffee A.  Bright.
Strong blueberry. Just had some "Columbian Red" something or other beans that tasted almost identical to it, so I have opinions! I like this as a special/occasional coffee but could not drink it daily. High acid, almost fruit tea like. Not enough desired coffee flavor for me (chocolate, caramel).
can't get past the "nose" of stale red wine funk to appreciated the complex fruit.
Graham cracker, blueberries
Berry/fruity
Very interesting. There were notes of pepper and almost vegetable like flavour. I put a little milk in to cut some of the acidity and the taste really opened up. Very nice
Prominent jam/berry/fruit notes and the most bright out of the selection. Not my preferred option as I typically do not enjoy fruitier coffees.
fermented. like a slightly fruity sourdough starter. getting more "fermented grain" than fruit.
Floral like an oolong from anxi or a tie guan yin, especially when hot. Preferred after it cooled and floral was less dominant on top of the fruit. Fruits are all over the place. Cooked down berries and jams/jelly. Some artificial like flavors of bubble gum and cherry coke. Bitter-sweet chocolate finish (85% cocoa bar). Relatively thinner texture.
sour smell and taste, musty, bit astringent, cider that started to go off.

Fruity and acidic but not overbearing
Grape, balance
Root vegetable - sweet potato
Blueberry, floral
Nutty, earthy, fruity
Not my preference - fermented flavors always make me think the milk has gone off.
Definitely the highest acid, roses/jasmine, red grapes
Thinnest mouthfeel, stone fruit, sour cherries
Very sour
fruity, rotten
Balanced, acid and bitter, blah aftertaste
Fruity, Sour, Berries
Apple, bordering on flavor vs. note.
This one had a very chocolatey kind of taste.
stone fruit, berries
Couldn't even stand to taste this one for me.
The first word I thought was "fun!" It was noticeably sweet.
Heavy body, light roast, sour apple
Fruity
nutty-ness.

red raspberry, cherry
The acidity on this one overpowered the bitterness
Sweet, unique scent, fruit, dried fruit, fermented
tea
fruit tea
fruity with creamy mouthfeel, like blueberry pie filling
funky fruity flavor, berries, single origin?
Punishment coffee, burnt
Very sour. After having this coffee first, it greatly altered the taste profile of the others. The taste grew softer over time.
green olive
Very sweet without tasting sugary, as I've heard James describe coffees in the past. By far my favorite.
Enjoyed the fruity-ness; Tasted the most complex and reminded me of a natural processed cold brew from local coffee roasters (Merit based in San Antonio TX)
Berry, caramel, sugar, lemon
Honey process ? light roast with something extra
Was much better with a raw sugar added
Weird
Fermented blueberry
vanilla
fruit punch. high acid, tannic. like this one a lot
Fruity, delicious!!
Notes of cherry - not an everyday coffee, but very good.
Strong fruit flavors, passion fruit, guava, bright
Increasingly fruity, strawberry, a little spicy at first
Good initially and then got even better later.
equally acidic and bitter not as smooth. grapefruit flavor
Strawberry, fruit
Sour candy, fruity
Very bright, as it cooled it got more fruity
Tropical, medium body
apple cider vinegar
Tabasco
Tastes just like blueberries.
Apple cider vinegar
This coffee tasted 'bright', funky, and juicy to me.  I was reminded of strawberries on the initial tastes, and that sensation grew with subsequent sampling.  For me, this was the tastiest of the bunch, though perhaps its intense flavor makes this an every-other-day coffee, rather than my daily preference.
Strawberry
Funky, Fruity
pineapple, honey, persimmon
Did not like, very frontal tasting, felt like a wallop. Bad chocolate.
Very sour, sweet
Fruit
Blueberry, citrus fruits, nuts, and vanilla.

Blueberry flavor; umami notes
Fruit, apple, grape
pineapple kumbucha
Thin, fruity, caramel, fermented
Fruity?
Cacao
Chocolate cherries. Raspberry. Blueberry, hecka berry notes. As cooled...mellower and more enjoyable, still berries. Interesting. Reminds me of an experimental craft beer, I'd love a pint of it, but maybe not a 6 pack. ($30 4 pack I mean).
Fermented, savory, balsamic vinegar/soy sauce.
Very fruity and a little funky, some sour berries
Plum, cherry
blueberry
Fruity and complex

tropical fruit candy deliciousness. My favorite by far, the anaerobic process here is the only thing I guessed correctly for the blind tasting.
clear, fruity
Watermelon?
Sharp! Fruity, acidic like limes and pineapples. Nice nutty finish.
This cup made me work, and I loved it.

Blueberries, sharp, acidic, juicy
Sour Berry
bright, warm, balanced, late: juicy apple, chocolate
Stout beer, cocoa, berry
ripe strawberry, fermented fruit, tea like body
Not sure if I am understanding acidity correctly - I was associating it with the fruitiness which this has a lot of similar to A, but this seemed warmer where as A seemed brighter so maybe the warm/bright is the acidity?
Notes of molasses and blackberry or cherry. Flavorful and delicious.
Very large mouthfeel. Strong residence/presence.
Fruity, raisin
Blueberry, Sour
I could taste and smell blueberries with this particular coffee.
Strawberry
blueberry, berries, somewhat thin, juicy, nice sweet linger
Overall favorite - smooth and refreshing. A little tart apple (your malic acid comment likely influenced me)

Berries and cream, complex, caramel
Too acidic and bitter. Not preferred at all.
Juicy, fruity, strong blueberry/berry notes

I could tell right away the distinctive anaerobic process flavor which sometimes love and some times hate.
very acidic tasting-citrusy- really don't like
Fruity
Pleasant fruit/berry aroma? Very unique, knew this was a natural as soon as I smelled it. I like this and would use this coffee to show others that coffee can taste different than their stereotypical expectations.
Personally, I would not drink this as a daily-driver because I prefer different flavors, but I would drink this occasionally.
Cider, wine, licorice

Blueberry
Thick mouth
Didn't like this at all.  It did get better as it cooled, but still not enjoyable.
Floor Cleaner
Lime - liked this one WAY better once I added milk and it cooled a little. Didn't really like just black/hot.
Very high acid, a bit of bitterness, but very funky/floral, earthy, fermented qualities, positive traits more than worth any bitterness
Sour cherry, lemon, green berry,
Asparagus
Probably the worst coffee I've ever had. Like drinking an over-ripe apple about to go bad.
Out of curiosity, I added some milk and sugar, and it somehow got worse.
Most interesting / unique coffee before. I've never had anything like this but will be seeking out more of this style. Slightly preferred Klatch due to its familiarity to me. 
Juicy, fruity, bright. Tropical fruits, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon zest. An amazing drinking experience and could see this becoming my preferred style in the future.

Chocolate and fig jam
Tangy, pear
Berries
Sangria, complex
Pineapple, this is the sort of coffee I tend to chose, very glad it was in the tasting
Cherries
fruity pebbles cereal.  perception or acidity / bitterness changed (mellow'd) as temp lowered.  I like these flavors a lot personally, but the overall fruity'ness is 15% too much for me as a go-to drinker.  I'm certainly no expert, but this hits me as a natural Ethiopian.
Blueberry
Fruity, trashy/rotten smell
Tropical fruit was mentioned during the tasting. I thought....fruity coffee?? Sure enough it had a fruit taste compared to the other xoffees. The Klatch was somewhat fruity as well. This was my least fav.
citrus, berry, sour
VERY berry forward, tart blueberries, raspberry, funky, experimental. Fun at a cafe, not for daily drinking.
Awful
By itself it was overwhelming but between other coffees was a nice Change up
dark chocolate, rich fruit, funky
Natural ofc
High acidity, fruity, berries, hogo
Out of the four on offer, I like this one the most, by far. A variety of fruit flavors, great acidity without being overbearing, plenty of complexity as the cup cooled. It's the cup I kept going back to when comparing the other three coffees.
Good full rounded texture. Very fruity, some sour funky notes. I really liked this, and found it to be the most interesting
Fruity
Full of character!  Dark chocolate notes, but very fruity forward like cherry, prune, plum, dates, maybe even a hint of pomegranate.  Reminds me of winter.  Sturdy enough to handle foamed milk, or half and half.
Blueberry
Thick mouth
Fruity, Black berries, sweet
Blueberry, chocolate
The acidity on this dominated… I tasted these more at room temperature. I would only enjoy this with something sweet like ripe fruit or white chocolate, I think. The tasting note is vaguely some sort of citrus/sour fruit.
Most different of the four, sweet/floral
Fruity, more fruity with each taste, more bitter with each taste.
Cherry
Fermented kinda funk, grapefruit maybe
Very fruity
Fruity.
Wow! Immediate strong cherry flavor came through, very juicy and complex. Most enjoyable when warm-hot. Wish I could order more.

Blackberry, Lemon, Herbal
Caramel. Watery.
Blueberry
Dried fruit, Cranberries
Sour, tasted worse over time, overly tart
Tasted like apple cider vinegar
Ripe blueberries
very fruity, blueberry cake
This coffee is the sort of coffee I would go to a cafe or buy small bags of specialty beans for. Very aggressive and fruity, I think it's aggressive enough that I would probably enjoy it less on a daily basis. 

Also as a milk drink it was teetering towards undrinkable, it really didn't work well with milk at all.
Bright, Granny Smith Apple
Unique, floral, hibiscus, fruity, for spécial days but not everyday consumptions.
Fruity, strawberry, natural washed
Fruity and funky
Hard to gauge bitterness due to fermented note
Generally dislike the flavor except after cognac

At room temp:
-High Clarity
-Juicy
-Berry Fruit
-I still can't believe it wasn't Yirgacheffe
Stonefruit, berries, blueberry
I let these cool probably too much as I got pulled away so that may explain the variance in my notes. It feels like I'm drinking cherry juice. It's very sweet, and almost too fruity for me.
Blueberry, lemon
Some funk, good acidity and jucyness in there. Difficult to say what fruit, but something crisp almost
Winey, tropical fruit, caramel
Taste of blackberry, juniper, lime, pineapple. I really like exploring these types of coffee, but is not a daily drinker for me.
Became very acidic upon cooling off
Mouth full of blueberries

Fruity, tea-like
Fruit! Tart, sweet, light, twisty
Too much fruit, lighter roast?, Floral.  Did not like.
Fruity
Tart cranberry
Very sweet, thick mouth feel, cloying. Tried to get past the surprise, but not what I want in a cup of coffee
the one that changed the most as the temperature changed. It smelled like fermented fruit when opened capsule. Really fruity, but in a stringent way.
Melon
Chocolate, red fruit, blueberry
Very fruity.  Blueberry.  Light mouthfeel.  Very acidic.  Sort of reminds me of sharp white cheddar and jam together.  Tastes very similar to an Ethiopian Wush Wush I had recently.

Screams natural process. Ethiopia? Fun and fruity as any good natural should be. Delicious but mood dependent.
Fruity: blueberry
Loved the mouthfeel
Juicy fruit
cherry, citrus zest, strawberry
Very fruity
This was an adventure! It felt the most "coffee nerd" of the bunch, if you will. I had two other friends doing the tasting, and I knew which one would like it and hate it the second I tasted. Love the strong berry notes to it, went through a phase when cooling where it reminded me of crunchberries from the serial? strawberry flavored things, but not the fresh fruit?

one comment: Oddly, tried this over ice and it'd be extremely refreshing in the summer. I didn't like it hot though.
Peach candy, stone fruit, slight tropical, slight jasmine
tastes like old boots and mushrooms. more viscous.
This one was fun, super bright and fruity, reminds me of a citrus fruit. Not sure id drink it every morning as it's definitely the least like coffee and more tea like, but I enjoyed every sip. Its negative marks for me are purely preference as there is nothing I didn't like about it.

Didn't enjoy the Fermented fruit flavors
Heavily blueberry up front- seemed like a flavored syrup adder.  Not pleasant as it cooled.

Very light body, no staying power, weirdly both bitter and acidic, I have actually no idea what this tastes like
I liked this one and found it super interesting, but liked A more
Strawberry, ferment flavor

i tasted none of the fruit and berries discussed in the livestream. i got mostly twigs and mulch and damp earthiness.
Sour Cherry
Very bright acidity that only brightened over time. Fruity with a more bitter aftertaste. I would love to pair this with a baked good. Sipping this enhanced the flavors of the other coffees. Given a color, the flavor is yellow.

First thought Olives (kalamata). Initially least favorite, but grew to second favorite. Tastes like pulp process, fermented.

Fruity/light acidity/better cooled /slightly sour
Cherry
Natural sweetness with notes of deep chocolate, berries and currants
Fruity
Caramel/toffee
This definitely felt the most "interesting" of the coffees, but also a little on the strongly sour side. It was something I could enjoy in a single cup experience, but I don't think I'd want cup after cup on an average day.

Fruity, with a 'crisp' bite.
absolutely lovely! this almost doesn't even taste like coffee to me and is so dang interesting!
Astringent, sour
I like that is was super fruity, it was surprising. On it's own, I dislike it. But made into something, I think it would be perfect (maybe a chocolate cake)
Nutty
Fruity
Black walnut
It reminded me of dessert wines I've had and did not enjoy. Almost saccharin sweet, probably from the fruit jumble I couldn't parse.
grapes, clarity, tea like body
What a sassy coffee. I'd describe it as musty/fermented fruit that was brewed in the earth. Each sip surprised me as much as the previous one. That said, still interesting and not particularly bad. More of a "once in a blue moon, if I'm feeling particularly fancy" type of coffee.
Blueberry, Funky
LOVED 💖 bluebery
floral
Cherry and Black Currant
fruity, blueberry
Fermented fruit, kiwi,cranberry, u ripe strawberry
Makes me stick out my tongue for oxygen

Too acidic for my taste. Jammy after cooling
Very fruity, juicy
I don’t love the fermented flavor but it was interesting.
Berries. Fermented.
Cantaloupe
Citrus, Orange
Blackcurrant
Berries. With some earth?
Bright kick, full flavor
Strawberry jam, agave, and a bit of a peanut-like note.
Most complex, liked it more as it cooled
Fruity, complex, acid with sweetness, my favorite.
Very fruity, sweet. Feel back of tongue at end. Color association is “red”. Thin, low body. Almost metallic, like pencil shavings??
I have never had coffee like this, it was simply incredible. Strong fruit flavours, blueberry and blackberries. I will by this coffee again, as pods and beans.
Raspberry, light
Fruity
Changed a lot as it cooled, at times tasted like A. Peanuts, lychee. The cooler it got the more tropical and citrus. Went from 2 to 4 acid as it cooled.
Best when hot nice natural coffee taste super fruity. The funk is one of the better natural coffees I’ve tasted
Didn't enjoy this at all.
Fruity but still coffee
Fruity, jam, Granny Smith apple
Very sour on the first taste. Flavor improved as it cooled
Tasted strongly of green apple
Flavor changed radically with milk.
When we tasted the cooled leftovers with whole milk, I really enjoyed it
Did not like it at all black, #2 preference with whole milk
Apple at first. Later blueberry. Reminds me of jammy pastry.
Wine, light in mouth
Fruity, bright, acidic…not good!

Green apple, acid, light, floral
Blueberry, fruity
Tasted like berries
When hot, found this very acidic and with intense fruitiness, mostly citrus, and did not much enjoy it. As it cooled, I found it to be much more balanced and found it quite interesting. but farther toward the very lighter roasts than I currently enjoy.

sour berry
Very light body. Paired well with some grapes : )

Dried berry, cocoa - dark chocolate, cinnamon

an easy choice for most flavorful and interesting, not a balanced experience, but a really nice funky finish.
Strong Fermented notes. Not sure if I would regularly drink this but it was super interesting.
Now going to have to look up v.chirosco. loved the sweet fruit. Wish I could submit this form and then another for my second cupping in a few days so I can include more granular notes.
Very fruity. Stood out as different from the others.
Fruity with blueberry notes, smooth silky mouthfeel with a lingering sweet finish (likely anaerobic fermented flavor enhancing the burst of flavor)

cranberry, apple, bergamot

tropical and sour; citrus; fermented papaya; tangy without being sharp
Very fruity - dark berries, subtle dark chocolate
I thought I caught a hint of baked goods, but wasn’t able to explore that more as the sourness was just too prominent for me.
Pear, Lychee
Very fruity both while hot and after it cooled
Muted
I’m confused lol, funky and fruity. Maybe plum?
I really like these kinds of coffees, very fruity, very juicy tasting, however it's not something I think I could drink everyday, it's like the secret stash of flavors, you would want to use as a Trump card for sure, like a 2nd cup of the day or if you aren't feeling Milk or creamer this would be a great option for the someone who likes to have a new flavor and spice up the monotony.
Blueberry/Plum
Has that weird processing that I like
Fruit Loops, tropical, pine
Very Fruity, Berry Notes
Fruity, bright, tea-like
Complex, peaty, dirty, funky sharpness. Note: Having over-diluted the last one there wasn't enough water left so slightly under-diluted.

Overall note: I never drink black coffee so this undoubtedly colored the tasting. I intend to replicate the tasting adding milk. I also despise raspberries and mint if that makes a difference.
fermented apple, mealy apple, sour
Raspberry, chocolate
Berries or other fruit, fermentation notes.
Blueberry -> fermented acidity -> light bitterness.
Chocolate and cherry
Worse, lower quality, italian cigar; tart cherry

Apricot, blueberry, fruit tart

sour. notes of cherry at first and strong notes of blueberry at the end. bright crisp finish.  This one had the most obvious flavor notes of the bunch which did make it more "fun".
Very acidic but the aftertaste is very enjoyable. Chery flavor
Tea with lemon light mold or extra funk
Did not like this at all untill adding vanilla creamer it became the most fruity and sweetest tasting, making it my overall preference.
But, BEST with creamer. Brought out the fruit flavors.
bizarre fruitiness with little acid when I tasted it hot, but really enjoyed it both hot and as it cooled; I'd had experience with anaerobic fermentation before and enjoyed this even more than what I'd had in the past
Each sip started with very little bitterness then finished with a lot of bitterness, especially bitter while piping hot.
Juicy, red fruit, like the flavor a lot
Ripe fruit, fermentation, banana, plants, crisp
Star anise, vinegar, complex
Most unique flavor, by far. Loved the complexity. Very smooth, thick texture. Very pleasant.
Was very bitter when hot. After cooling, flavor changed a lot and the bitterness wasn’t present until the aftertaste
Fruit
Fruity, fermented, winey

Soft and rolling aroma that arrives fairly quick. Flavor slopes gently down in a convex fashion, carrying a slight nutty taste to the end.
Fruit, Raspberry, Bright
Jackfruit, Blueberry, Jasmine
Fruity, bright, sweet, clean, delicious
Nutty, Woody
Some extremely strong fruity something. It’s repulsive, really, I couldn’t get past that to taste anything else. If there was a -5 on the preference scale, even that would be too kind.

I felt bad wasting the milk and sugar on this, but *science*. I think it actually tasted worse, I would’ve spat it out if that would’ve helped. So awful.
Fruity, sweet, peaches
Honey
Apricot

Enjoyed. Thought natural.

Very tart.  don't like.
Fruity funk crisp
Blueberry
Dark berries, pineapple core, clementine. My favorite out of the bunch! Even with liking all four coffees this one felt and tasted like the kinds of coffee I drink at home. A black coffee drinker would find this exciting and approachable, and it so happens one of the earliest coffees that excited me had a lot of berry notes
Grass, sour
Chocolate
Grape juice and black raspberry
fruity, citrus
Blueberry, clementine, dried pineapple

Fruity, medium body
Poison
Black berry
Very much enjoyed this coffee. Tasted like a very juicy, dark blueberry and also of raspberries. Had a difficult time choosing a favorite between A and D. 

While these were obviously prepared the same way, I almost liken their flavors to that of a pour over vs an espresso. Coffee A was a great, well rounded coffee that I could drink every time I made coffee, ie a pour over. D was a more bold, explosion of flavor that was a delight to drink, but may tire out my tastebuds if I drank it every time I made coffee, ie espresso.
Fruity, kiwi/citrus
This coffee is frankly rancid. It tastes like it's rotten and quite unpleasant to drink

Nailed this as a dry process right away. More than likely Ethiopian. Pomegranate. Got more complex as cooled down.
Blueberries, toasted coconut, pomegranate
Fruity, cascara notes, light nut
Complex floral fruit, natural process
Reminds if tangy fruit, like orange with spice
Taste very fruity(black current) at first, very nice, but after cool down, taste very  acidic, bad tart dry. Didn’t like it at all at the end.
Fruit!  Berries!  Blueberry donut.  Clearly natural.  Love it.
Berry, Fruit, Blackberry
Fruity, unripe raspberry, sour/acidic

Strangely sweet

Really fruity taste, scored it highly on acidity due to that (and making a mental map that the two are related, which if not true the result would need adjustment)
grapefruit, sour
Natural tasting. Very lightly Fermenty. Blueberry flavors
I really enjoy the fermented fruit flavor of this one--it stands out as something special. I'm not sure if I'd want it as my daily driver, but it was the one I enjoyed the most out of the four.

complex, fermented, fruity, don't think I'd drink a full cup of it
Strong berry flavor. Blueberry? Almost tea-like quality.
I don’t like fermented coffees, and that experience led to interpret its taste as sour, and therefore acidic. I enjoyed hearing how quality affects different parts of the tongue.
Banana
Citrus, blueberry, ripe fruit
Very fruity - notes of strawberries or raspberries?  
Too fruity for an everyday preference - would make a good after dinner or a nice coffee jelly dessert.
complex, fruity
Although I do like certain fruit notes, this one is a combo I dislike. I've tried to acquire a taste for coffees like this and just can't get over a sour fruit taste that ruins the coffee for me personally. I will say this coffee did get better the cooler it got. I gave it a fair shake but it's just not a coffee I would enjoy.
Berry, candy apple, green tea, honey
Very fruity and bright, consistent throughout temps
Taste was slightly more bitter not much stronger
BERRY BERRY KIX CEREAL, CHOCOLATE MILK. WHILE VERY TASTY, I CAN NOT IMAGINE DRINKING A WHOLE MUG OF THIS, LET ALONE A BAG OR PACKAGE OF CAPSULES. PROBABLY QUITE LOVELY AS ESPRESSO. MAYBE A LITTLE 120ML AMERICANO.

A bit too funky for me
Started more thick, warm, and spicy. Cherry, dark pit fruits, dark berry. Very interesting, sort of tea-like and a little floral and fruity.
Bad fruit flavor, strange aftertaste, hard to get a bead on why I didn't like it.
Raspberry, tea-like
Guessed origin: Mexico (wrong)
Heavier mouthfeel, kind of harsh. Woody / black tea flavors, unpleasant aftertaste (noted when still pretty warm, didn't revisit as often as I probably should've while it cooled until after the scores were locked in, at which point it was much more obviously fruity)
Funk, smarties, Froot Loops, amazing clarity
Blueberry
Sweet, balanced, cherry, creamy, chocolate
Strawberry jam and pineapple
Raspberries, Caramel, malt
Like blueberry syrup. Thick, acidic and sickly sweet
This is what I usually drink. Notes of cantaloupe, watermelon. Tasted like a Kenyan or Ethiopian Natural.

Vile. Tastes like rotten lemons. Made me physically shudder. Horrible mouth feel.

Lemony citrus tart acidic flavor.
Fermented/fruity
Strong tart berry flavor, reminded me of wild black huckleberries that grew behind my house as a kid.
Apple
Smooth, almond
Fruit like apples
Pretzel
Very juicy!  And, in a way that I guessed must be South American. :)  I loved this one — especially when hot.  The fragrance is phenomenal!
Fruit blackberries, thin, good clarity
Very fruity
Distinctive taste.. amazing as on specialty coffee but not day to day
Horrid
Soy sauce, fermented fruit, chocolate, nuts
Reminded me of fruit, lighter roast maybe? Personally do not prefer the fruitier coffee options.
I found this one really interesting. Kind of a raspberry mixed with grape flavor to me.
Classic B&W funk, which I usually don't care for. Actually ended up enjoying much more as it cooled down, lots of fruit.
This one was disgusting. Just awful.
Did someone steep a bad blueberry muffin in this coffee??
Cider and a harvest festival feel
Raspberries. This is the coffee I could drink all day.
Nice tropical fruit flavors. Finish of coconut was nice.
Flavor was reminiscent of a chocolate orange
Nutmeg, earthy flavors at the start. Some fruitier flavors developed over time. bitterness increased over time, I instantly thought it was naturally processed. Very complex.  Bitterness and acidity are both present. Acidity seemed to decrease as bitterness increased over time. Relatively balanced. Great mouthfeel, seems heavy.
Green apple, black tea
Sour apple
Apple juice, orange chocolate
Tastes like late-stage capitalism.
Very citrusy
Tropical (pineapple), bright, lack of richness

Flavored, artificial fruit, chocolate/blueberry, artificial acidity?
Strong slightly sour smell
Fruity. Some kind of berry. I want more like this.
I didn’t initially like this one that much… but shortly after starting the taste test, I started being reminded of extra dark chocolate after the coffee cleared from my mouth. Even though it’s not as bitter as the other ones

Very good, I liked the fruity, acidic taste more than I thought I would
There is some sour fruitiness that I can’t seem to find myself enjoying.
I thought this tasted more bitter to me, and I really enjoyed it. Reminded me of chocolate raspberry.
Very fruity
Ghastly. Fermented fruit.
Fruit bomb
Fruity
I'm not drinking this again, way way too flavorful in a way I did not enjoy, reminded me of some fruit based drinks or wine in a bad way, my reaction grew to where I stopped taste testing it near the end
Orange/citrus. Evolved the most for me.
Blueberry
tastes like anaerobic bourbon like
Very fruity, almost a funky/fermented note in there?
Berries, cranberry, sour.  Acidity dropped dramatically as temp dropped.
The coffee had a nutty, almond-y quality at first taste and then it left with a berry fruity quality at the end.  However, as the coffee cooled the nutty quality almost became muted and the acidity level seems to come out more.  It was definitely became a similar taste profile as Coffee A but even in the end, it didn't have the same intensity as A.
grass, bright, fruit, weak, adventurous
Plumby, stone fruit, tangerine
Fermented fruit, tropical, guava,
rainier cherries, fresh peaches
Felt overpowering, almost wished I still felt some of the bitterness, could not enjoy when cold at all
Fruity
This one presented almost the same throughout the test with very few changes. I was convinced there was high levels of acidity until the end of the test (after I had locked in my answers) and I was asked to assess if only the flavors implied acidity rather than there actually being acidity present. It was quite sweet and fruity and fermenty and I enjoyed it quite a lot.
Tea like, Juicy, green apple, floral as it cooled

Medium mouthful. Mango and cherry notes. Tastes like a natural.
I loved this one. I’m not surprised as the one coffee I have tried from Black and white was a very funky, sour roast that I loved.

Juicy, sour candy is what I tasted with a thicker mouthfeel that made me want to slurp it. Full bodied and sharp as hell, I mean there’s no other way to describe that intense funk.
fruity, cherry notes, or maybe raspberry, tangy, light, bright
Almost rotten fruit
Sour Apple, raw chocolate
Wine, floral
This one had a fruity taste to it, which, initially I found unpleasant, but it grew on me overtime. It had like a berry flavor. I found this the most interesting coffee of the four in terms of taste. I Felt that this was a coffee that I would really enjoy iced in hot weather. Looking forward to trying this one again.
Very smooth, relatively full body for a light roast, pineapple, blackberry, apple
Traces of tree bark, after taste of slightly rancid oil.
Marmele
Wildly variable as it cooled
very very acidic, made me shiver!
thinnest coffee of the group

There were some berry notes, but far too acidic for my personal preference.

Fermented flavor

This was my favorite coffee from hot to cool from the batch. 
Loved how interesting it tasted, and got a ton of berry notes out of it. 
It was also quite light in body with just the right amount of acidity which I love as well. 
Very close to the kind of coffee I normally drink.

I like this one! Very distinct from the other coffees. Feels very clear, with fruity notes and maybe a hint of pepper. The fruity notes are somewhat nuanced, like raisin or raspberry? There is a certain tartness that isn’t quite necessarily sour. Overall tastes most similar to the coffees that I prefer to drink if I’m not adding any milk
sour, ferment-y
Lemon, Kiwi, light
Had an odd funk
Capri-sun, pineapple front flavor, light mango aftertaste
Blueberry
Hollow
Tasted like gas station coffee. Very strong without a lot of flavor. Somewhat dry.
lemon juice, slightly rotted fruit
Can I give this a 6+ on my likes? Bright. fruity. Would buy and drink over and over. Really got a LOT of citrus. Mouth feel like what I get from a great red wine. Tropical and complex. SEXY AS HELL. Where do I buy this? Surprised that I liked it since the acidity was not there (I usually like a bite).
Raspberry, floral
natural, fermented blueberry

more complex flavor, "strong" cup. "darker" version of A?

Cantaloupe rind, berry, tomato juice
Blueberry, berry jam, lime
Earthy, tree bark, dirt
This was a chameleon of a coffee. It seemed to be really dependent on which coffee we had beforehand. If I drink this after the George Howell, it tasted funky. Almost cheesy. After equator, it was very fruity. After Klatch, more of the roasting notes came out. This is a coffee that I would want to drink by myself so that I could really ponder it while I drink it. I also probably couldn't have more than one cup of it at a time.
Dislike this coffee smell and taste so much it comes close to turning my stomach.  No coffee ever did that to me before..  I don't understand this reaction.  Word that comes to mind is putrid.
sour-ish at the beginning; incredible development after several minutes.

Mix of darker and lighter maybe milk chocolate and slight fruit, less clarity

Apple, chocolate, much brighter as it cools down. Fruity undertones. Some slightly bitter bite to balance it out. Fruity flavor is slightly tart. Very smooth cup.
I loved this coffee.  The light, fruity (blueberry?) notes were so enjoyable and my friend next to me was shocked at the range that coffee can deliver in terms of flavor.

Fruity, juicy, drying
Red Fruit
Very strong blueberry notes. Not usually what I would drink but very enjoyable.
Not for me.
The surprise blueberry note on the front of each sip set this coffee apart. It added something fun to what would otherwise have been fine but unremarkable.
Loved this weird one! Funky, fermenty, fruit acid (dark fruit, blackberry). Guessed Ethiopia

Fruity, raspberry, smooth, chocolate cherry

Too floral for me, doesn't work well with a cream.
Fruit and berries. Cranberry sort of astringency. Calmed down a lot as it cooled.
Very fruit forward, first sip was like a shot of unsweetened blueberry pancake syrup then got softer after a few more sips.
My least favorite of the 4, quality was good, I just personally am not a fruit coffee fan
Dark chocolate blueberries

A balanced cup of coffee. Some acidity to help counterbalance the bitterness. It would be delightful with a fresh glazed donut.
Similar to A, but roast was too light for my preference.
fruity
I remember enjoying this one, but it felt middle of the pack to me compared to coffees A and B
Fruity, strong aroma and even taste of off teriyaki sauce, actively disliked this and no amount of sugar or cream helped, once James said it was fermented things made more sense as this was my first experience with fermented coffee
Full flavored, fruity, complex, a little pleasant vegetal note
Berry, chocolate
Fruity, very acidic, berry like, some burdock or dandelion flavor
It was a bit bitter but was very rounded. Didn't love the kick it gives you but not the worst
